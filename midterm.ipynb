This technical companion considers each principle in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and \\nprovides examples and concrete steps for communities, industry, governments, and others to take in order to \\nbuild these protections into policy, practice, or the technological design process. \\nTaken together, the technical protections and practices laid out in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights can help \\nguard the American public against many of the potential and actual harms identified by researchers, technolo\\xad\\ngists, advocates, journalists, policymakers, and communities in the United States and around the world. This \\ntechnical companion is intended to be used as a reference by people across many circumstances – anyone \\nimpacted by automated systems, and anyone developing, designing, deploying, evaluating, or making policy to \\ngovern the use of an automated system. \\nEach principle is accompanied by three supplemental sections: \\n1\\n2\\nWHY THIS PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANT: \\nThis section provides a brief summary of the problems that the principle seeks to address and protect against, including \\nillustrative examples. \\nWHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS: \\n• The expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional technical\\nstandards and practices that should be tailored for particular sectors and contexts.\\n• This section outlines practical steps that can be implemented to realize the vision of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. The \\nexpectations laid out often mirror existing practices for technology development, including pre-deployment testing, ongoing \\nmonitoring, and governance structures for automated systems, but also go further to address unmet needs for change and offer \\nconcrete directions for how those changes can be made. \\n• Expectations about reporting are intended for the entity developing or using the automated system. The resulting reports can \\nbe provided to the public, regulators, auditors, industry standards groups, or others engaged in independent review, and should \\nbe made public as much as possible consistent with law, regulation, and policy, and noting that intellectual property, law \\nenforcement, or national security considerations may prevent public release. Where public reports are not possible, the \\ninformation should be provided to oversight bodies and privacy, civil liberties, or other ethics officers charged with safeguard \\ning individuals’ rights. These reporting expectations are important for transparency, so the American people can have\\nconfidence that their rights, opportunities, and access as well as their expectations about technologies are respected. \\n3\\nHOW THESE PRINCIPLES CAN MOVE INTO PRACTICE: \\nThis section provides real-life examples of how these guiding principles can become reality, through laws, policies, and practices. \\nIt describes practical technical and sociotechnical approaches to protecting rights, opportunities, and access. \\nThe examples provided are not critiques or endorsements, but rather are offered as illustrative cases to help \\nprovide a concrete vision for actualizing the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. Effectively implementing these \\nprocesses require the cooperation of and collaboration among industry, civil society, researchers, policymakers, \\ntechnologists, and the public. \\n14\\n'}"

AI RMF proﬁles assist organizations in deciding how to \\nbest manage AI risks in a manner that is well-aligned with their goals, considers legal/regulatory \\nrequirements and best practices, and reﬂects risk management priorities. Consistent with other AI RMF \\nproﬁles, this proﬁle oﬀers insights into how risk can be managed across various stages of the AI lifecycle \\nand for GAI as a technology.  \\nAs GAI covers risks of models or applications that can be used across use cases or sectors, this document \\nis an AI RMF cross-sectoral proﬁle. Cross-sectoral proﬁles can be used to govern, map, measure, and \\nmanage risks associated with activities or business processes common across sectors, such as the use of \\nlarge language models (LLMs), cloud-based services, or acquisition. \\nThis document deﬁnes risks that are novel to or exacerbated by the use of GAI. After introducing and \\ndescribing these risks, the document provides a set of suggested actions to help organizations govern, \\nmap, measure, and manage these risks. \\n \\n \\n1 EO 14110 deﬁnes Generative AI as “the class of AI models that emulate the structure and characteristics of input \\ndata in order to generate derived synthetic content. This can include images, videos, audio, text, and other digital \\ncontent.” While not all GAI is derived from foundation models, for purposes of this document, GAI generally refers \\nto generative foundation models. The foundation model subcategory of “dual-use foundation models” is deﬁned by \\nEO 14110 as “an AI model that is trained on broad data; generally uses self-supervision; contains at least tens of \\nbillions of parameters; is applicable across a wide range of contexts.”  \\n2 This proﬁle was developed per Section 4.1(a)(i)(A) of EO 14110, which directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting \\nthrough the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to develop a companion \\nresource to the AI RMF, NIST AI 100–1, for generative AI. \\n \\n2 \\nThis work was informed by public feedback and consultations with diverse stakeholder groups as part of NIST’s \\nGenerative AI Public Working Group (GAI PWG). The GAI PWG was an open, transparent, and collaborative \\nprocess, facilitated via a virtual workspace, to obtain multistakeholder input on GAI risk management and to \\ninform NIST’s approach. \\nThe focus of the GAI PWG was limited to four primary considerations relevant to GAI: Governance, Content \\nProvenance, Pre-deployment Testing, and Incident Disclosure (further described in Appendix A). As such, the \\nsuggested actions in this document primarily address these considerations. \\nFuture revisions of this proﬁle will include additional AI RMF subcategories, risks, and suggested actions based \\non additional considerations of GAI as the space evolves and empirical evidence indicates additional risks. A \\nglossary of terms pertinent to GAI risk management will be developed and hosted on NIST’s Trustworthy & \\nResponsible AI Resource Center (AIRC), and added to The Language of Trustworthy AI: An In-Depth Glossary of \\nTerms. \\nThis document was also informed by public comments and consultations from several Requests for Information. \\n ')"

In other cases, technologies do not work as intended or as promised, causing substantial and unjustified harm. \\nAutomated systems sometimes rely on data from other systems, including historical data, allowing irrelevant informa\\xad\\ntion from past decisions to infect decision-making in unrelated situations.  In some cases, technologies are purposeful\\xad\\nly designed to violate the safety of others, such as technologies designed to facilitate stalking; in other cases, intended \\nor unintended uses lead to unintended harms. \\nMany of the harms resulting from these technologies are preventable, and actions are already being taken to protect \\nthe public. Some companies have put in place safeguards that have prevented harm from occurring by ensuring that \\nkey development decisions are vetted by an ethics review; others have identified and mitigated harms found through \\npre-deployment testing and ongoing monitoring processes. Governments at all levels have existing public consulta\\xad\\ntion processes that may be applied when considering the use of new automated systems, and existing product develop\\xad\\nment and testing practices already protect the American public from many potential harms. \\nStill, these kinds of practices are deployed too rarely and unevenly. Expanded, proactive protections could build on \\nthese existing practices, increase confidence in the use of automated systems, and protect the American public. Inno\\xad\\nvators deserve clear rules of the road that allow new ideas to flourish, and the American public deserves protections \\nfrom unsafe outcomes. All can benefit from assurances that automated systems will be designed, tested, and consis\\xad\\ntently confirmed to work as intended, and that they will be proactively protected from foreseeable unintended harm\\xad\\nful outcomes. \\n•\\nA proprietary model was developed to predict the likelihood of sepsis in hospitalized patients and was imple\\xad\\nmented at hundreds of hospitals around the country.

These expectations are explained below. \\nProtect the public from harm in a proactive and ongoing manner \\nConsultation. The public should be consulted in the design, implementation, deployment, acquisition, and \\nmaintenance phases of automated system development, with emphasis on early-stage consultation before a \\nsystem is introduced or a large change implemented. This consultation should directly engage diverse impact\\xad\\ned communities to consider concerns and risks that may be unique to those communities, or disproportionate\\xad\\nly prevalent or severe for them. The extent of this engagement and the form of outreach to relevant stakehold\\xad\\ners may differ depending on the specific automated system and development phase, but should include \\nsubject matter, sector-specific, and context-specific experts as well as experts on potential impacts such as \\ncivil rights, civil liberties, and privacy experts. For private sector applications, consultations before product \\nlaunch may need to be confidential. Government applications, particularly law enforcement applications or \\napplications that raise national security considerations, may require confidential or limited engagement based \\non system sensitivities and preexisting oversight laws and structures. Concerns raised in this consultation \\nshould be documented, and the automated system developers were proposing to create, use, or deploy should \\nbe reconsidered based on this feedback. \\nTesting. Systems should undergo extensive testing before deployment. This testing should follow \\ndomain-specific best practices, when available, for ensuring the technology will work in its real-world \\ncontext. Such testing should take into account both the specific technology used and the roles of any human \\noperators or reviewers who impact system outcomes or effectiveness; testing should include both automated \\nsystems testing and human-led (manual) testing. Testing conditions should mirror as closely as possible the \\nconditions in which the system will be deployed, and new testing may be required for each deployment to \\naccount for material differences in conditions from one deployment to another. Following testing, system \\nperformance should be compared with the in-place, potentially human-driven, status quo procedures, with \\nexisting human performance considered as a performance baseline for the algorithm to meet pre-deployment, \\nand as a lifecycle minimum performance standard. Decision possibilities resulting from performance testing \\nshould include the possibility of not deploying the system. \\nRisk identification and mitigation. Before deployment, and in a proactive and ongoing manner, poten\\xad\\ntial risks of the automated system should be identified and mitigated. Identified risks should focus on the \\npotential for meaningful impact on people’s rights, opportunities, or access and include those to impacted \\ncommunities that may not be direct users of the automated system, risks resulting from purposeful misuse of \\nthe system, and other concerns identified via the consultation process. Assessment and, where possible, mea\\xad\\nsurement of the impact of risks should be included and balanced such that high impact risks receive attention \\nand mitigation proportionate with those impacts. Automated systems with the intended purpose of violating \\nthe safety of others should not be developed or used; systems with such safety violations as identified unin\\xad\\ntended consequences should not be used until the risk can be mitigated. Ongoing risk mitigation may necessi\\xad\\ntate rollback or significant modification to a launched automated system. \\n18\\n'),\n",

Automated systems should have ongoing monitoring procedures, including recalibra\\xad\\ntion procedures, in place to ensure that their performance does not fall below an acceptable level over time, \\nbased on changing real-world conditions or deployment contexts, post-deployment modification, or unexpect\\xad\\ned conditions. This ongoing monitoring should include continuous evaluation of performance metrics and \\nharm assessments, updates of any systems, and retraining of any machine learning models as necessary, as well \\nas ensuring that fallback mechanisms are in place to allow reversion to a previously working system. Monitor\\xad\\ning should take into account the performance of both technical system components (the algorithm as well as \\nany hardware components, data inputs, etc.) and human operators. It should include mechanisms for testing \\nthe actual accuracy of any predictions or recommendations generated by a system, not just a human operator’s \\ndetermination of their accuracy. Ongoing monitoring procedures should include manual, human-led monitor\\xad\\ning as a check in the event there are shortcomings in automated monitoring systems. These monitoring proce\\xad\\ndures should be in place for the lifespan of the deployed automated system. \\nClear organizational oversight. Entities responsible for the development or use of automated systems \\nshould lay out clear governance structures and procedures.  This includes clearly-stated governance proce\\xad\\ndures before deploying the system, as well as responsibility of specific individuals or entities to oversee ongoing \\nassessment and mitigation. Organizational stakeholders including those with oversight of the business process \\nor operation being automated, as well as other organizational divisions that may be affected due to the use of \\nthe system, should be involved in establishing governance procedures. Responsibility should rest high enough \\nin the organization that decisions about resources, mitigation, incident response, and potential rollback can be \\nmade promptly, with sufficient weight given to risk mitigation objectives against competing concerns. Those \\nholding this responsibility should be made aware of any use cases with the potential for meaningful impact on \\npeople’s rights, opportunities, or access as determined based on risk identification procedures.  In some cases, \\nit may be appropriate for an independent ethics review to be conducted before deployment. \\nAvoid inappropriate, low-quality, or irrelevant data use and the compounded harm of its \\nreuse \\nRelevant and high-quality data. Data used as part of any automated system’s creation, evaluation, or \\ndeployment should be relevant, of high quality, and tailored to the task at hand. Relevancy should be \\nestablished based on research-backed demonstration of the causal influence of the data to the specific use case \\nor justified more generally based on a reasonable expectation of usefulness in the domain and/or for the \\nsystem design or ongoing development. Relevance of data should not be established solely by appealing to \\nits historical connection to the outcome. High quality and tailored data should be representative of the task at \\nhand and errors from data entry or other sources should be measured and limited. Any data used as the target \\nof a prediction process should receive particular attention to the quality and validity of the predicted outcome \\nor label to ensure the goal of the automated system is appropriately identified and measured. Additionally, \\njustification should be documented for each data attribute and source to explain why it is appropriate to use \\nthat data to inform the results of the automated system and why such use will not violate any applicable laws. \\nIn cases of high-dimensional and/or derived attributes, such justifications can be provided as overall \\ndescriptions of the attribute generation process and appropriateness. \\n19\\n'),\n",

Data that is derived from other data through \\nthe use of algorithms, such as data derived or inferred from prior model outputs, should be identified and \\ntracked, e.g., via a specialized type in a data schema. Derived data should be viewed as potentially high-risk \\ninputs that may lead to feedback loops, compounded harm, or inaccurate results. Such sources should be care\\xad\\nfully validated against the risk of collateral consequences. \\nData reuse limits in sensitive domains. Data reuse, and especially data reuse in a new context, can result \\nin the spreading and scaling of harms. Data from some domains, including criminal justice data and data indi\\xad\\ncating adverse outcomes in domains such as finance, employment, and housing, is especially sensitive, and in \\nsome cases its reuse is limited by law. Accordingly, such data should be subject to extra oversight to ensure \\nsafety and efficacy. Data reuse of sensitive domain data in other contexts (e.g., criminal data reuse for civil legal \\nmatters or private sector use) should only occur where use of such data is legally authorized and, after examina\\xad\\ntion, has benefits for those impacted by the system that outweigh identified risks and, as appropriate, reason\\xad\\nable measures have been implemented to mitigate the identified risks.

These principles—while taking into account the sensitive law enforcement and other contexts in which \\nthe federal government may use AI, as opposed to private sector use of AI—require that AI is: (a) lawful and \\nrespectful of our Nation’s values; (b) purposeful and performance-driven; (c) accurate, reliable, and effective; (d) \\nsafe, secure, and resilient; (e) understandable; (f ) responsible and traceable; (g) regularly monitored; (h) transpar-\\nent; and, (i) accountable. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is consistent with the Executive Order. \\nAffected agencies across the federal government have released AI use case inventories13 and are implementing \\nplans to bring those AI systems into compliance with the Executive Order or retire them. \\nThe law and policy landscape for motor vehicles shows that strong safety regulations—and \\nmeasures to address harms when they occur—can enhance innovation in the context of com-\\nplex technologies. Cars, like automated digital systems, comprise a complex collection of components. \\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,14 through its rigorous standards and independent \\nevaluation, helps make sure vehicles on our roads are safe without limiting manufacturers’ ability to \\ninnovate.15 At the same time, rules of the road are implemented locally to impose contextually appropriate \\nrequirements on drivers, such as slowing down near schools or playgrounds.16\\nFrom large companies to start-ups, industry is providing innovative solutions that allow \\norganizations to mitigate risks to the safety and efficacy of AI systems, both before \\ndeployment and through monitoring over time.17 These innovative solutions include risk \\nassessments, auditing mechanisms, assessment of organizational procedures, dashboards to allow for ongoing \\nmonitoring, documentation procedures specific to model assessments, and many other strategies that aim to \\nmitigate risks posed by the use of AI to companies’ reputation, legal responsibilities, and other product safety \\nand effectiveness concerns. \\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has called for an expansion of opportunities \\nfor meaningful stakeholder engagement in the design of programs and services. OMB also \\npoints to numerous examples of effective and proactive stakeholder engagement, including the Community-\\nBased Participatory Research Program developed by the National Institutes of Health and the participatory \\ntechnology assessments developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.18\\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing a risk \\nmanagement framework to better manage risks posed to individuals, organizations, and \\nsociety by AI.19 The NIST AI Risk Management Framework, as mandated by Congress, is intended for \\nvoluntary use to help incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and \\nevaluation of AI products, services, and systems. The NIST framework is being developed through a consensus-\\ndriven, open, transparent, and collaborative process that includes workshops and other opportunities to provide \\ninput. The NIST framework aims to foster the development of innovative approaches to address \\ncharacteristics of trustworthiness including accuracy, explainability and interpretability, reliability, privacy, \\nrobustness, safety, security (resilience), and mitigation of unintended and/or harmful bias, as well as of \\nharmful \\nuses. \\nThe \\nNIST \\nframework \\nwill \\nconsider \\nand \\nencompass \\nprinciples \\nsuch \\nas \\ntransparency, accountability, and fairness during pre-design, design and development, deployment, use, \\nand testing and evaluation of AI technologies and systems.

For example, facial recognition technology that can contribute to wrongful and discriminatory \\narrests,31 hiring algorithms that inform discriminatory decisions, and healthcare algorithms that discount \\nthe severity of certain diseases in Black Americans. Instances of discriminatory practices built into and \\nresulting from AI and other automated systems exist across many industries, areas, and contexts. While automated \\nsystems have the capacity to drive extraordinary advances and innovations, algorithmic discrimination \\nprotections should be built into their design, deployment, and ongoing use. \\nMany companies, non-profits, and federal government agencies are already taking steps to ensure the public \\nis protected from algorithmic discrimination. Some companies have instituted bias testing as part of their product \\nquality assessment and launch procedures, and in some cases this testing has led products to be changed or not \\nlaunched, preventing harm to the public. Federal government agencies have been developing standards and guidance \\nfor the use of automated systems in order to help prevent bias. Non-profits and companies have developed best \\npractices for audits and impact assessments to help identify potential algorithmic discrimination and provide \\ntransparency to the public in the mitigation of such biases. \\nBut there is much more work to do to protect the public from algorithmic discrimination to use and design \\nautomated systems in an equitable way. The guardrails protecting the public from discrimination in their daily \\nlives should include their digital lives and impacts—basic safeguards against abuse, bias, and discrimination to \\nensure that all people are treated fairly when automated systems are used. This includes all dimensions of their \\nlives, from hiring to loan approvals, from medical treatment and payment to encounters with the criminal \\njustice system. Ensuring equity should also go beyond existing guardrails to consider the holistic impact that \\nautomated systems make on underserved communities and to institute proactive protections that support these \\ncommunities. \\n•\\nAn automated system using nontraditional factors such as educational attainment and employment history as\\npart of its loan underwriting and pricing model was found to be much more likely to charge an applicant who\\nattended a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) higher loan prices for refinancing a student loan\\nthan an applicant who did not attend an HBCU. This was found to be true even when controlling for\\nother credit-related factors.32\\n•\\nA hiring tool that learned the features of a company's employees (predominantly men) rejected women appli\\xad\\ncants for spurious and discriminatory reasons; resumes with the word “women’s,” such as “women’s\\nchess club captain,” were penalized in the candidate ranking.33\\n•\\nA predictive model marketed as being able to predict whether students are likely to drop out of school was\\nused by more than 500 universities across the country. The model was found to use race directly as a predictor,\\nand also shown to have large disparities by race; Black students were as many as four times as likely as their\\notherwise similar white peers to be deemed at high risk of dropping out. These risk scores are used by advisors \\nto guide students towards or away from majors, and some worry that they are being used to guide\\nBlack students away from math and science subjects.34\\n•\\nA risk assessment tool designed to predict the risk of recidivism for individuals in federal custody showed\\nevidence of disparity in prediction. The tool overpredicts the risk of recidivism for some groups of color on the\\ngeneral recidivism tools, and underpredicts the risk of recidivism for some groups of color on some of the\\nviolent recidivism tools.

For example, the analyzer marked the statement “I’m a Jew” as representing a negative sentiment,\\nwhile “I’m a Christian” was identified as expressing a positive sentiment.36 This could lead to the\\npreemptive blocking of social media comments such as: “I’m gay.” A related company with this bias concern\\nhas made their data public to encourage researchers to help address the issue37 and has released reports\\nidentifying and measuring this problem as well as detailing attempts to address it.38\\n•\\nSearches for “Black girls,” “Asian girls,” or “Latina girls” return predominantly39 sexualized content, rather\\nthan role models, toys, or activities.40 Some search engines have been working to reduce the prevalence of\\nthese results, but the problem remains.41\\n•\\nAdvertisement delivery systems that predict who is most likely to click on a job advertisement end up deliv-\\nering ads in ways that reinforce racial and gender stereotypes, such as overwhelmingly directing supermar-\\nket cashier ads to women and jobs with taxi companies to primarily Black people.42\\xad\\n•\\nBody scanners, used by TSA at airport checkpoints, require the operator to select a “male” or “female”\\nscanning setting based on the passenger’s sex, but the setting is chosen based on the operator’s perception of\\nthe passenger’s gender identity.

Protection against algorithmic discrimination should include designing to ensure equity, broadly \\nconstrued.  Some algorithmic discrimination is already prohibited under existing anti-discrimination law. The \\nexpectations set out below describe proactive technical and policy steps that can be taken to not only \\nreinforce those legal protections but extend beyond them to ensure equity for underserved communities48 \\neven in circumstances where a specific legal protection may not be clearly established. These protections \\nshould be instituted throughout the design, development, and deployment process and are described below \\nroughly in the order in which they would be instituted. \\nProtect the public from algorithmic discrimination in a proactive and ongoing manner \\nProactive assessment of equity in design. Those responsible for the development, use, or oversight of \\nautomated systems should conduct proactive equity assessments in the design phase of the technology \\nresearch and development or during its acquisition to review potential input data, associated historical \\ncontext, accessibility for people with disabilities, and societal goals to identify potential discrimination and \\neffects on equity resulting from the introduction of the technology. The assessed groups should be as inclusive \\nas possible of the underserved communities mentioned in the equity definition:  Black, Latino, and Indigenous \\nand Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of \\nreligious minorities; women, girls, and non-binary people; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and inter-\\nsex (LGBTQI+) persons; older adults; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons \\notherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. Assessment could include both qualitative \\nand quantitative evaluations of the system. This equity assessment should also be considered a core part of the \\ngoals of the consultation conducted as part of the safety and efficacy review. \\nRepresentative and robust data. Any data used as part of system development or assessment should be \\nrepresentative of local communities based on the planned deployment setting and should be reviewed for bias \\nbased on the historical and societal context of the data. Such data should be sufficiently robust to identify and \\nhelp to mitigate biases and potential harms. \\nGuarding against proxies.  Directly using demographic information in the design, development, or \\ndeployment of an automated system (for purposes other than evaluating a system for discrimination or using \\na system to counter discrimination) runs a high risk of leading to algorithmic discrimination and should be \\navoided. In many cases, attributes that are highly correlated with demographic features, known as proxies, can \\ncontribute to algorithmic discrimination. In cases where use of the demographic features themselves would \\nlead to illegal algorithmic discrimination, reliance on such proxies in decision-making (such as that facilitated \\nby an algorithm) may also be prohibited by law. Proactive testing should be performed to identify proxies by \\ntesting for correlation between demographic information and attributes in any data used as part of system \\ndesign, development, or use. If a proxy is identified, designers, developers, and deployers should remove the \\nproxy; if needed, it may be possible to identify alternative attributes that can be used instead. At a minimum, \\norganizations should ensure a proxy feature is not given undue weight and should monitor the system closely \\nfor any resulting algorithmic discrimination.   \\n26\\nAlgorithmic \\nDiscrimination \\nProtections \\n'),\n",

Systems should be \\ndesigned, developed, and deployed by organizations in ways that ensure accessibility to people with disabili\\xad\\nties. This should include consideration of a wide variety of disabilities, adherence to relevant accessibility \\nstandards, and user experience research both before and after deployment to identify and address any accessi\\xad\\nbility barriers to the use or effectiveness of the automated system. \\nDisparity assessment. Automated systems should be tested using a broad set of measures to assess wheth\\xad\\ner the system components, both in pre-deployment testing and in-context deployment, produce disparities. \\nThe demographics of the assessed groups should be as inclusive as possible of race, color, ethnicity, sex \\n(including pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions, gender identity, intersex status, and sexual \\norientation), religion, age, national origin, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or any other classifi\\xad\\ncation protected by law. The broad set of measures assessed should include demographic performance mea\\xad\\nsures, overall and subgroup parity assessment, and calibration. Demographic data collected for disparity \\nassessment should be separated from data used for the automated system and privacy protections should be \\ninstituted; in some cases it may make sense to perform such assessment using a data sample. For every \\ninstance where the deployed automated system leads to different treatment or impacts disfavoring the identi\\xad\\nfied groups, the entity governing, implementing, or using the system should document the disparity and a \\njustification for any continued use of the system. \\nDisparity mitigation. When a disparity assessment identifies a disparity against an assessed group, it may \\nbe appropriate to take steps to mitigate or eliminate the disparity. In some cases, mitigation or elimination of \\nthe disparity may be required by law. \\nDisparities that have the potential to lead to algorithmic \\ndiscrimination, cause meaningful harm, or violate equity49 goals should be mitigated. When designing and \\nevaluating an automated system, steps should be taken to evaluate multiple models and select the one that \\nhas the least adverse impact, modify data input choices, or otherwise identify a system with fewer \\ndisparities. If adequate mitigation of the disparity is not possible, then the use of the automated system \\nshould be reconsidered. One of the considerations in whether to use the system should be the validity of any \\ntarget measure; unobservable targets may result in the inappropriate use of proxies. Meeting these \\nstandards may require instituting mitigation procedures and other protective measures to address \\nalgorithmic discrimination, avoid meaningful harm, and achieve equity goals. \\nOngoing monitoring and mitigation. Automated systems should be regularly monitored to assess algo\\xad\\nrithmic discrimination that might arise from unforeseen interactions of the system with inequities not \\naccounted for during the pre-deployment testing, changes to the system after deployment, or changes to the \\ncontext of use or associated data. Monitoring and disparity assessment should be performed by the entity \\ndeploying or using the automated system to examine whether the system has led to algorithmic discrimina\\xad\\ntion when deployed. This assessment should be performed regularly and whenever a pattern of unusual \\nresults is occurring. It can be performed using a variety of approaches, taking into account whether and how \\ndemographic information of impacted people is available, for example via testing with a sample of users or via \\nqualitative user experience research. Riskier and higher-impact systems should be monitored and assessed \\nmore frequently. Outcomes of this assessment should include additional disparity mitigation, if needed, or \\nfallback to earlier procedures in the case that equity standards are no longer met and can't be mitigated, and \\nprior mechanisms provide better adherence to equity standards. \\n27\\nAlgorithmic \\nDiscrimination \\nProtections \\n\"),\n",

The Action Plan to Advance Property Appraisal and Valuation \\nEquity includes a commitment from the agencies that oversee mortgage lending to include a \\nnondiscrimination standard in the proposed rules for Automated Valuation Models.52\\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Justice have clearly \\nlaid out how employers’ use of AI and other automated systems can result in \\ndiscrimination against job applicants and employees with disabilities.53 The documents explain \\nhow employers’ use of software that relies on algorithmic decision-making may violate existing requirements \\nunder Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). This technical assistance also provides practical \\ntips to employers on how to comply with the ADA, and to job applicants and employees who think that their \\nrights may have been violated. \\nDisparity assessments identified harms to Black patients' healthcare access. A widely \\nused healthcare algorithm relied on the cost of each patient’s past medical care to predict future medical needs, \\nrecommending early interventions for the patients deemed most at risk. This process discriminated \\nagainst Black patients, who generally have less access to medical care and therefore have generated less cost \\nthan white patients with similar illness and need. A landmark study documented this pattern and proposed \\npractical ways that were shown to reduce this bias, such as focusing specifically on active chronic health \\nconditions or avoidable future costs related to emergency visits and hospitalization.54 \\nLarge employers have developed best practices to scrutinize the data and models used \\nfor hiring. An industry initiative has developed Algorithmic Bias Safeguards for the Workforce, a structured \\nquestionnaire that businesses can use proactively when procuring software to evaluate workers. It covers \\nspecific technical questions such as the training data used, model training process, biases identified, and \\nmitigation steps employed.55 \\nStandards organizations have developed guidelines to incorporate accessibility criteria \\ninto technology design processes. The most prevalent in the United States is the Access Board’s Section \\n508 regulations,56 which are the technical standards for federal information communication technology (software, \\nhardware, and web).

Surveil\\xad\\nlance and data collection, sharing, use, and reuse now sit at the foundation of business models across many industries, \\nwith more and more companies tracking the behavior of the American public, building individual profiles based on \\nthis data, and using this granular-level information as input into automated systems that further track, profile, and \\nimpact the American public. Government agencies, particularly law enforcement agencies, also use and help develop \\na variety of technologies that enhance and expand surveillance capabilities, which similarly collect data used as input \\ninto other automated systems that directly impact people’s lives. Federal law has not grown to address the expanding \\nscale of private data collection, or of the ability of governments at all levels to access that data and leverage the means \\nof private collection.  \\nMeanwhile, members of the American public are often unable to access their personal data or make critical decisions \\nabout its collection and use. Data brokers frequently collect consumer data from numerous sources without \\nconsumers’ permission or knowledge.60 Moreover, there is a risk that inaccurate and faulty data can be used to \\nmake decisions about their lives, such as whether they will qualify for a loan or get a job. Use of surveillance \\ntechnologies has increased in schools and workplaces, and, when coupled with consequential management and \\nevaluation decisions, it is leading to mental health harms such as lowered self-confidence, anxiety, depression, and \\na reduced ability to use analytical reasoning.61 Documented patterns show that personal data is being aggregated by \\ndata brokers to profile communities in harmful ways.62 The impact of all this data harvesting is corrosive, \\nbreeding distrust, anxiety, and other mental health problems; chilling speech, protest, and worker organizing; and \\nthreatening our democratic process.63 The American public should be protected from these growing risks. \\nIncreasingly, some companies are taking these concerns seriously and integrating mechanisms to protect consumer \\nprivacy into their products by design and by default, including by minimizing the data they collect, communicating \\ncollection and use clearly, and improving security practices. Federal government surveillance and other collection and \\nuse of data is governed by legal protections that help to protect civil liberties and provide for limits on data retention \\nin some cases. Many states have also enacted consumer data privacy protection regimes to address some of these \\nharms. \\nHowever, these are not yet standard practices, and the United States lacks a comprehensive statutory or regulatory \\nframework governing the rights of the public when it comes to personal data.

The American public should be protect\\xad\\ned via built-in privacy protections, data minimization, use and collection limitations, and transparency, in addition \\nto being entitled to clear mechanisms to control access to and use of their data—including their metadata—in a \\nproactive, informed, and ongoing way. Any automated system collecting, using, sharing, or storing personal data \\nshould meet these expectations. \\nProtect privacy by design and by default \\nPrivacy by design and by default. Automated systems should be designed and built with privacy protect\\xad\\ned by default. Privacy risks should be assessed throughout the development life cycle, including privacy risks \\nfrom reidentification, and appropriate technical and policy mitigation measures should be implemented. This \\nincludes potential harms to those who are not users of the automated system, but who may be harmed by \\ninferred data, purposeful privacy violations, or community surveillance or other community harms. Data \\ncollection should be minimized and clearly communicated to the people whose data is collected. Data should \\nonly be collected or used for the purposes of training or testing machine learning models if such collection and \\nuse is legal and consistent with the expectations of the people whose data is collected. User experience \\nresearch should be conducted to confirm that people understand what data is being collected about them and \\nhow it will be used, and that this collection matches their expectations and desires. \\nData collection and use-case scope limits. Data collection should be limited in scope, with specific, \\nnarrow identified goals, to avoid \"mission creep.\"  Anticipated data collection should be determined to be \\nstrictly necessary to the identified goals and should be minimized as much as possible. Data collected based on \\nthese identified goals and for a specific context should not be used in a different context without assessing for \\nnew privacy risks and implementing appropriate mitigation measures, which may include express consent. \\nClear timelines for data retention should be established, with data deleted as soon as possible in accordance \\nwith legal or policy-based limitations. Determined data retention timelines should be documented and justi\\xad\\nfied. \\nRisk identification and mitigation. Entities that collect, use, share, or store sensitive data should \\nattempt to proactively identify harms and seek to manage them so as to avoid, mitigate, and respond appropri\\xad\\nately to identified risks. Appropriate responses include determining not to process data when the privacy risks \\noutweigh the benefits or implementing measures to mitigate acceptable risks. Appropriate responses do not \\ninclude sharing or transferring the privacy risks to users via notice or consent requests where users could not \\nreasonably be expected to understand the risks without further support. \\nPrivacy-preserving security. Entities creating, using, or governing automated systems should follow \\nprivacy and security best practices designed to ensure data and metadata do not leak beyond the specific \\nconsented use case.

Surveillance or monitoring systems should be subject to \\nheightened oversight that includes at a minimum assessment of potential harms during design (before deploy\\xad\\nment) and in an ongoing manner, to ensure that the American public’s rights, opportunities, and access are \\nprotected. This assessment should be done before deployment and should give special attention to ensure \\nthere is not algorithmic discrimination, especially based on community membership, when deployed in a \\nspecific real-world context. Such assessment should then be reaffirmed in an ongoing manner as long as the \\nsystem is in use. \\nLimited and proportionate surveillance. Surveillance should be avoided unless it is strictly necessary \\nto achieve a legitimate purpose and it is proportionate to the need. Designers, developers, and deployers of \\nsurveillance systems should use the least invasive means of monitoring available and restrict monitoring to the \\nminimum number of subjects possible. To the greatest extent possible consistent with law enforcement and \\nnational security needs, individuals subject to monitoring should be provided with clear and specific notice \\nbefore it occurs and be informed about how the data gathered through surveillance will be used. \\nScope limits on surveillance to protect rights and democratic values. Civil liberties and civil \\nrights must not be limited by the threat of surveillance or harassment facilitated or aided by an automated \\nsystem. Surveillance systems should not be used to monitor the exercise of democratic rights, such as voting, \\nprivacy, peaceful assembly, speech, or association, in a way that limits the exercise of civil rights or civil liber\\xad\\nties. Information about or algorithmically-determined assumptions related to identity should be carefully \\nlimited if used to target or guide surveillance systems in order to avoid algorithmic discrimination; such iden\\xad\\ntity-related information includes group characteristics or affiliations, geographic designations, location-based \\nand association-based inferences, social networks, and biometrics. Continuous surveillance and monitoring \\nsystems should not be used in physical or digital workplaces (regardless of employment status), public educa\\xad\\ntional institutions, and public accommodations. Continuous surveillance and monitoring systems should not \\nbe used in a way that has the effect of limiting access to critical resources or services or suppressing the exer\\xad\\ncise of rights, even where the organization is not under a particular duty to protect those rights. \\nProvide the public with mechanisms for appropriate and meaningful consent, access, and \\ncontrol over their data \\nUse-specific consent. Consent practices should not allow for abusive surveillance practices. Where data \\ncollectors or automated systems seek consent, they should seek it for specific, narrow use contexts, for specif\\xad\\nic time durations, and for use by specific entities. Consent should not extend if any of these conditions change; \\nconsent should be re-acquired before using data if the use case changes, a time limit elapses, or data is trans\\xad\\nferred to another entity (including being shared or sold).

Depending on the technological use case and \\nbased on an ethical assessment, consent for sensitive data may need to be acquired from a guardian and/or child. \\nProvide enhanced protections for data related to sensitive domains \\nNecessary functions only. Sensitive data should only be used for functions strictly necessary for that \\ndomain or for functions that are required for administrative reasons (e.g., school attendance records), unless \\nconsent is acquired, if appropriate, and the additional expectations in this section are met. Consent for non-\\nnecessary functions should be optional, i.e., should not be required, incentivized, or coerced in order to \\nreceive opportunities or access to services. In cases where data is provided to an entity (e.g., health insurance \\ncompany) in order to facilitate payment for such a need, that data should only be used for that purpose. \\nEthical review and use prohibitions. Any use of sensitive data or decision process based in part on sensi-\\ntive data that might limit rights, opportunities, or access, whether the decision is automated or not, should go \\nthrough a thorough ethical review and monitoring, both in advance and by periodic review (e.g., via an indepen-\\ndent ethics committee or similarly robust process). In some cases, this ethical review may determine that data \\nshould not be used or shared for specific uses even with consent. Some novel uses of automated systems in this \\ncontext, where the algorithm is dynamically developing and where the science behind the use case is not well \\nestablished, may also count as human subject experimentation, and require special review under organizational \\ncompliance bodies applying medical, scientific, and academic human subject experimentation ethics rules and \\ngovernance procedures. \\nData quality. In sensitive domains, entities should be especially careful to maintain the quality of data to \\navoid adverse consequences arising from decision-making based on flawed or inaccurate data. Such care is \\nnecessary in a fragmented, complex data ecosystem and for datasets that have limited access such as for fraud \\nprevention and law enforcement. It should be not left solely to individuals to carry the burden of reviewing and \\ncorrecting data. Entities should conduct regular, independent audits and take prompt corrective measures to \\nmaintain accurate, timely, and complete data. \\nLimit access to sensitive data and derived data. Sensitive data and derived data should not be sold, \\nshared, or made public as part of data brokerage or other agreements. Sensitive data includes data that can be \\nused to infer sensitive information; even systems that are not directly marketed as sensitive domain technologies \\nare expected to keep sensitive data private. Access to such data should be limited based on necessity and based \\non a principle of local control, such that those individuals closest to the data subject have more access while \\nthose who are less proximate do not (e.g., a teacher has access to their students’ daily progress data while a \\nsuperintendent does not). \\nReporting. In addition to the reporting on data privacy (as listed above for non-sensitive data), entities devel-\\noping technologies related to a sensitive domain and those collecting, using, storing, or sharing sensitive data \\nshould, whenever appropriate, regularly provide public reports describing: any data security lapses or breaches \\nthat resulted in sensitive data leaks; the number, type, and outcomes of ethical pre-reviews undertaken; a \\ndescription of any data sold, shared, or made public, and how that data was assessed to determine it did not pres-\\nent a sensitive data risk; and ongoing risk identification and management procedures, and any mitigation added \\nbased on these procedures.

Among other things, the Privacy Act limits the storage of individual \\ninformation in federal systems of records, illustrating the principle of limiting the scope of data retention. Under \\nthe Privacy Act, federal agencies may only retain data about an individual that is “relevant and necessary” to \\naccomplish an agency’s statutory purpose or to comply with an Executive Order of the President. The law allows \\nfor individuals to be able to access any of their individual information stored in a federal system of records, if not \\nincluded under one of the systems of records exempted pursuant to the Privacy Act. In these cases, federal agen\\xad\\ncies must provide a method for an individual to determine if their personal information is stored in a particular \\nsystem of records, and must provide procedures for an individual to contest the contents of a record about them. \\nFurther, the Privacy Act allows for a cause of action for an individual to seek legal relief if a federal agency does not \\ncomply with the Privacy Act’s requirements. Among other things, a court may order a federal agency to amend or \\ncorrect an individual’s information in its records or award monetary damages if an inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, \\nor incomplete record results in an adverse determination about an individual’s “qualifications, character, rights, … \\nopportunities…, or benefits.” \\nNIST’s Privacy Framework provides a comprehensive, detailed and actionable approach for \\norganizations to manage privacy risks. The NIST Framework gives organizations ways to identify and \\ncommunicate their privacy risks and goals to support ethical decision-making in system, product, and service \\ndesign or deployment, as well as the measures they are taking to demonstrate compliance with applicable laws \\nor regulations. It has been voluntarily adopted by organizations across many different sectors around the world.78\\nA school board’s attempt to surveil public school students—undertaken without \\nadequate community input—sparked a state-wide biometrics moratorium.79 Reacting to a plan in \\nthe city of Lockport, New York, the state’s legislature banned the use of facial recognition systems and other \\n“biometric identifying technology” in schools until July 1, 2022.80 The law additionally requires that a report on \\nthe privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties implications of the use of such technologies be issued before \\nbiometric identification technologies can be used in New York schools. \\nFederal law requires employers, and any consultants they may retain, to report the costs \\nof surveilling employees in the context of a labor dispute, providing a transparency \\nmechanism to help protect worker organizing. Employers engaging in workplace surveillance \"where \\nan object there-of, directly or indirectly, is […] to obtain information concerning the activities of employees or a \\nlabor organization in connection with a labor dispute\" must report expenditures relating to this surveillance to \\nthe Department of Labor Office of Labor-Management Standards, and consultants who employers retain for \\nthese purposes must also file reports regarding their activities.81\\nPrivacy choices on smartphones show that when technologies are well designed, privacy \\nand data agency can be meaningful and not overwhelming. These choices—such as contextual, timely \\nalerts about location tracking—are brief, direct, and use-specific. Many of the expectations listed here for \\nprivacy by design and use-specific consent mirror those distributed to developers as best practices when \\ndeveloping for smart phone devices,82 such as being transparent about how user data will be used, asking for app \\npermissions during their use so that the use-context will be clear to users, and ensuring that the app will still \\nwork if users deny (or later revoke) some permissions. \\n39\\n'),\n",

Like\\xad\\nwise, the public is often unable to ascertain how or why an automated system has made a decision or contributed to a \\nparticular outcome. The decision-making processes of automated systems tend to be opaque, complex, and, therefore, \\nunaccountable, whether by design or by omission. These factors can make explanations both more challenging and \\nmore important, and should not be used as a pretext to avoid explaining important decisions to the people impacted \\nby those choices.

Techniques used to automate the \\nprocess of explaining such systems are under active research and improvement and such explanations can take many \\nforms. Innovative companies and researchers are rising to the challenge and creating and deploying explanatory \\nsystems that can help the public better understand decisions that impact them. \\nWhile notice and explanation requirements are already in place in some sectors or situations, the American public \\ndeserve to know consistently and across sectors if an automated system is being used in a way that impacts their rights, \\nopportunities, or access.

The Biometric Information Privacy Act enacted by the state contains a number of provisions \\nconcerning the use of individual biometric data and identifiers. Included among them is a provision that no private \\nentity may \"collect, capture, purchase, receive through trade, or otherwise obtain\" such information about an \\nindividual, unless written notice is provided to that individual or their legally appointed representative. 87\\nMajor technology companies are piloting new ways to communicate with the public about \\ntheir automated technologies. For example, a collection of non-profit organizations and companies have \\nworked together to develop a framework that defines operational approaches to transparency for machine \\nlearning systems.88 This framework, and others like it,89 inform the public about the use of these tools, going \\nbeyond simple notice to include reporting elements such as safety evaluations, disparity assessments, and \\nexplanations of how the systems work. \\nLenders are required by federal law to notify consumers about certain decisions made about \\nthem. Both the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act require in certain circumstances \\nthat consumers who are denied credit receive \"adverse action\" notices. Anyone who relies on the information in a \\ncredit report to deny a consumer credit must, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, provide an \"adverse action\" \\nnotice to the consumer, which includes \"notice of the reasons a creditor took adverse action on the application \\nor on an existing credit account.\"90 In addition, under the risk-based pricing rule,91 lenders must either inform \\nborrowers of their credit score, or else tell consumers when \"they are getting worse terms because of \\ninformation in their credit report.\" The CFPB has also asserted that \"[t]he law gives every applicant the right to \\na specific explanation if their application for credit was denied, and that right is not diminished simply because \\na company uses a complex algorithm that it doesn\\'t understand.\"92 Such explanations illustrate a shared value \\nthat certain decisions need to be explained. \\nA California law requires that warehouse employees are provided with notice and explana-\\ntion about quotas, potentially facilitated by automated systems, that apply to them. Warehous-\\ning employers in California that use quota systems (often facilitated by algorithmic monitoring systems) are \\nrequired to provide employees with a written description of each quota that applies to the employee, including \\n“quantified number of tasks to be performed or materials to be produced or handled, within the defined \\ntime period, and any potential adverse employment action that could result from failure to meet the quota.”93\\nAcross the federal government, agencies are conducting and supporting research on explain-\\nable AI systems.

A multidis-\\nciplinary team of researchers aims to develop measurement methods and best practices to support the \\nimplementation of core tenets of explainable AI.94 The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has a \\nprogram on Explainable Artificial Intelligence that aims to create a suite of machine learning techniques that \\nproduce more explainable models, while maintaining a high level of learning performance (prediction \\naccuracy), and enable human users to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage the emerging \\ngeneration of artificially intelligent partners.95 The National Science Foundation’s program on Fairness in \\nArtificial Intelligence also includes a specific interest in research foundations for explainable AI.96\\n45\\n'),\n",

Yet members of the public are often \\npresented with no alternative, or are forced to endure a cumbersome process to reach a human decision-maker once \\nthey decide they no longer want to deal exclusively with the automated system or be impacted by its results. As a result \\nof this lack of human reconsideration, many receive delayed access, or lose access, to rights, opportunities, benefits, \\nand critical services. The American public deserves the assurance that, when rights, opportunities, or access are \\nmeaningfully at stake and there is a reasonable expectation of an alternative to an automated system, they can conve\\xad\\nniently opt out of an automated system and will not be disadvantaged for that choice. In some cases, such a human or \\nother alternative may be required by law, for example it could be required as “reasonable accommodations” for people \\nwith disabilities. \\nIn addition to being able to opt out and use a human alternative, the American public deserves a human fallback \\nsystem in the event that an automated system fails or causes harm. No matter how rigorously an automated system is \\ntested, there will always be situations for which the system fails. The American public deserves protection via human \\nreview against these outlying or unexpected scenarios. In the case of time-critical systems, the public should not have \\nto wait—immediate human consideration and fallback should be available. In many time-critical systems, such a \\nremedy is already immediately available, such as a building manager who can open a door in the case an automated \\ncard access system fails. \\nIn the criminal justice system, employment, education, healthcare, and other sensitive domains, automated systems \\nare used for many purposes, from pre-trial risk assessments and parole decisions to technologies that help doctors \\ndiagnose disease. Absent appropriate safeguards, these technologies can lead to unfair, inaccurate, or dangerous \\noutcomes. These sensitive domains require extra protections. It is critically important that there is extensive human \\noversight in such settings. \\nThese critical protections have been adopted in some scenarios. Where automated systems have been introduced to \\nprovide the public access to government benefits, existing human paper and phone-based processes are generally still \\nin place, providing an important alternative to ensure access. Companies that have introduced automated call centers \\noften retain the option of dialing zero to reach an operator. When automated identity controls are in place to board an \\nairplane or enter the country, there is a person supervising the systems who can be turned to for help or to appeal a \\nmisidentification. \\nThe American people deserve the reassurance that such procedures are in place to protect their rights, opportunities, \\nand access. People make mistakes, and a human alternative or fallback mechanism will not always have the right \\nanswer, but they serve as an important check on the power and validity of automated systems. \\n• An automated signature matching system is used as part of the voting process in many parts of the country to\\ndetermine whether the signature on a mail-in ballot matches the signature on file. These signature matching\\nsystems are less likely to work correctly for some voters, including voters with mental or physical\\ndisabilities, voters with shorter or hyphenated names, and voters who have changed their name.97 A human\\ncuring process,98 which helps voters to confirm their signatures and correct other voting mistakes, is\\nimportant to ensure all votes are counted,99 and it is already standard practice in much of the country for\\nboth an election official and the voter to have the opportunity to review and correct any such issues.100 \\n47\\n'),\n",

Some panelists also raised the issue of \\npower structures – providing examples of how strong transparency requirements in smart city projects \\nhelped to reshape power and give more voice to those lacking the financial or political power to effect change. \\nIn discussion of technical and governance interventions that that are needed to protect against the harms \\nof these technologies, various panelists emphasized the need for transparency, data collection, and \\nflexible and reactive policy development, analogous to how software is continuously updated and deployed. \\nSome panelists pointed out that companies need clear guidelines to have a consistent environment for \\ninnovation, with principles and guardrails being the key to fostering responsible innovation. \\nPanel 2: The Criminal Justice System. This event explored current and emergent uses of technology in \\nthe criminal justice system and considered how they advance or undermine public safety, justice, and \\ndemocratic values. \\nWelcome: \\n•\\nSuresh Venkatasubramanian, Assistant Director for Science and Justice, White House Office of Science\\nand Technology Policy\\n•\\nBen Winters, Counsel, Electronic Privacy Information Center\\nModerator: Chiraag Bains, Deputy Assistant to the President on Racial Justice & Equity \\nPanelists: \\n•\\nSean Malinowski, Director of Policing Innovation and Reform, University of Chicago Crime Lab\\n•\\nKristian Lum, Researcher\\n•\\nJumana Musa, Director, Fourth Amendment Center, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers\\n•\\nStanley Andrisse, Executive Director, From Prison Cells to PHD; Assistant Professor, Howard University\\nCollege of Medicine\\n•\\nMyaisha Hayes, Campaign Strategies Director, MediaJustice\\nPanelists discussed uses of technology within the criminal justice system, including the use of predictive \\npolicing, pretrial risk assessments, automated license plate readers, and prison communication tools. The \\ndiscussion emphasized that communities deserve safety, and strategies need to be identified that lead to safety; \\nsuch strategies might include data-driven approaches, but the focus on safety should be primary, and \\ntechnology may or may not be part of an effective set of mechanisms to achieve safety. Various panelists raised \\nconcerns about the validity of these systems, the tendency of adverse or irrelevant data to lead to a replication of \\nunjust outcomes, and the confirmation bias and tendency of people to defer to potentially inaccurate automated \\nsystems. Throughout, many of the panelists individually emphasized that the impact of these systems on \\nindividuals and communities is potentially severe: the systems lack individualization and work against the \\nbelief that people can change for the better, system use can lead to the loss of jobs and custody of children, and \\nsurveillance can lead to chilling effects for communities and sends negative signals to community members \\nabout how they're viewed. \\nIn discussion of technical and governance interventions that that are needed to protect against the harms of \\nthese technologies, various panelists emphasized that transparency is important but is not enough to achieve \\naccountability. Some panelists discussed their individual views on additional system needs for validity, and \\nagreed upon the importance of advisory boards and compensated community input early in the design process \\n(before the technology is built and instituted). Various panelists also emphasized the importance of regulation \\nthat includes limits to the type and cost of such technologies. \\n56\\n\"),\n",

This event explored current and emerging uses of \\ntechnology that impact equity of opportunity in employment, education, and housing. \\nWelcome: \\n•\\nRashida Richardson, Senior Policy Advisor for Data and Democracy, White House Office of Science and\\nTechnology Policy\\n•\\nDominique Harrison, Director for Technology Policy, The Joint Center for Political and Economic\\nStudies\\nModerator: Jenny Yang, Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Department of Labor \\nPanelists: \\n•\\nChristo Wilson, Associate Professor of Computer Science, Northeastern University\\n•\\nFrida Polli, CEO, Pymetrics\\n•\\nKaren Levy, Assistant Professor, Department of Information Science, Cornell University\\n•\\nNatasha Duarte, Project Director, Upturn\\n•\\nElana Zeide, Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska College of Law\\n•\\nFabian Rogers, Constituent Advocate, Office of NY State Senator Jabari Brisport and Community\\nAdvocate and Floor Captain, Atlantic Plaza Towers Tenants Association\\nThe individual panelists described the ways in which AI systems and other technologies are increasingly being \\nused to limit access to equal opportunities in education, housing, and employment. Education-related \\nconcerning uses included the increased use of remote proctoring systems, student location and facial \\nrecognition tracking, teacher evaluation systems, robot teachers, and more. Housing-related concerning uses \\nincluding automated tenant background screening and facial recognition-based controls to enter or exit \\nhousing complexes. Employment-related concerning uses included discrimination in automated hiring \\nscreening and workplace surveillance. Various panelists raised the limitations of existing privacy law as a key \\nconcern, pointing out that students should be able to reinvent themselves and require privacy of their student \\nrecords and education-related data in order to do so. The overarching concerns of surveillance in these \\ndomains included concerns about the chilling effects of surveillance on student expression, inappropriate \\ncontrol of tenants via surveillance, and the way that surveillance of workers blurs the boundary between work \\nand life and exerts extreme and potentially damaging control over workers' lives. Additionally, some panelists \\npointed out ways that data from one situation was misapplied in another in a way that limited people's \\nopportunities, for example data from criminal justice settings or previous evictions being used to block further \\naccess to housing. Throughout, various panelists emphasized that these technologies are being used to shift the \\nburden of oversight and efficiency from employers to workers, schools to students, and landlords to tenants, in \\nways that diminish and encroach on equality of opportunity; assessment of these technologies should include \\nwhether they are genuinely helpful in solving an identified problem. \\nIn discussion of technical and governance interventions that that are needed to protect against the harms of \\nthese technologies, panelists individually described the importance of: receiving community input into the \\ndesign and use of technologies, public reporting on crucial elements of these systems, better notice and consent \\nprocedures that ensure privacy based on context and use case, ability to opt-out of using these systems and \\nreceive a fallback to a human process, providing explanations of decisions and how these systems work, the \\nneed for governance including training in using these systems, ensuring the technological use cases are \\ngenuinely related to the goal task and are locally validated to work, and the need for institution and protection \\nof third party audits to ensure systems continue to be accountable and valid. \\n57\\n\"),\n",

Various panelists suggested that these harms could be \\nmitigated by ensuring community input at the beginning of the design process, providing ways to opt out of \\nthese systems and use associated human-driven mechanisms instead, ensuring timeliness of benefit payments, \\nand providing clear notice about the use of these systems and clear explanations of how and what the \\ntechnologies are doing. Some panelists suggested that technology should be used to help people receive \\nbenefits, e.g., by pushing benefits to those in need and ensuring automated decision-making systems are only \\nused to provide a positive outcome; technology shouldn't be used to take supports away from people who need \\nthem. \\nPanel 6: The Healthcare System.

AI RMF proﬁles assist organizations in deciding how to \\nbest manage AI risks in a manner that is well-aligned with their goals, considers legal/regulatory \\nrequirements and best practices, and reﬂects risk management priorities. Consistent with other AI RMF \\nproﬁles, this proﬁle oﬀers insights into how risk can be managed across various stages of the AI lifecycle \\nand for GAI as a technology.  \\nAs GAI covers risks of models or applications that can be used across use cases or sectors, this document \\nis an AI RMF cross-sectoral proﬁle. Cross-sectoral proﬁles can be used to govern, map, measure, and \\nmanage risks associated with activities or business processes common across sectors, such as the use of \\nlarge language models (LLMs), cloud-based services, or acquisition. \\nThis document deﬁnes risks that are novel to or exacerbated by the use of GAI. After introducing and \\ndescribing these risks, the document provides a set of suggested actions to help organizations govern, \\nmap, measure, and manage these risks. \\n \\n \\n1 EO 14110 deﬁnes Generative AI as “the class of AI models that emulate the structure and characteristics of input \\ndata in order to generate derived synthetic content. This can include images, videos, audio, text, and other digital \\ncontent.” While not all GAI is derived from foundation models, for purposes of this document, GAI generally refers \\nto generative foundation models. The foundation model subcategory of “dual-use foundation models” is deﬁned by \\nEO 14110 as “an AI model that is trained on broad data; generally uses self-supervision; contains at least tens of \\nbillions of parameters; is applicable across a wide range of contexts.”  \\n2 This proﬁle was developed per Section 4.1(a)(i)(A) of EO 14110, which directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting \\nthrough the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to develop a companion \\nresource to the AI RMF, NIST AI 100–1, for generative AI. \\n \\n2 \\nThis work was informed by public feedback and consultations with diverse stakeholder groups as part of NIST’s \\nGenerative AI Public Working Group (GAI PWG). The GAI PWG was an open, transparent, and collaborative \\nprocess, facilitated via a virtual workspace, to obtain multistakeholder input on GAI risk management and to \\ninform NIST’s approach. \\nThe focus of the GAI PWG was limited to four primary considerations relevant to GAI: Governance, Content \\nProvenance, Pre-deployment Testing, and Incident Disclosure (further described in Appendix A). As such, the \\nsuggested actions in this document primarily address these considerations. \\nFuture revisions of this proﬁle will include additional AI RMF subcategories, risks, and suggested actions based \\non additional considerations of GAI as the space evolves and empirical evidence indicates additional risks. A \\nglossary of terms pertinent to GAI risk management will be developed and hosted on NIST’s Trustworthy & \\nResponsible AI Resource Center (AIRC), and added to The Language of Trustworthy AI: An In-Depth Glossary of \\nTerms. \\nThis document was also informed by public comments and consultations from several Requests for Information. \\n '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'section': '\\n2. \\nOverview of Risks Unique to or Exacerbated by GAI'}, page_content=' \\nIn the context of the AI RMF, risk refers to the composite measure of an event’s probability (or \\nlikelihood) of occurring and the magnitude or degree of the consequences of the corresponding event. \\nSome risks can be assessed as likely to materialize in a given context, particularly those that have been \\nempirically demonstrated in similar contexts. Other risks may be unlikely to materialize in a given \\ncontext, or may be more speculative and therefore uncertain. \\nAI risks can diﬀer from or intensify traditional software risks. Likewise, GAI can exacerbate existing AI \\nrisks, and creates unique risks. GAI risks can vary along many dimensions: \\n• \\nStage of the AI lifecycle: Risks can arise during design, development, deployment, operation, \\nand/or decommissioning. \\n• \\nScope: Risks may exist at individual model or system levels, at the application or implementation \\nlevels (i.e., for a speciﬁc use case), or at the ecosystem level – that is, beyond a single system or \\norganizational context. Examples of the latter include the expansion of “algorithmic \\nmonocultures,3” resulting from repeated use of the same model, or impacts on access to \\nopportunity, labor markets, and the creative economies.4 \\n• \\nSource of risk: Risks may emerge from factors related to the design, training, or operation of the \\nGAI model itself, stemming in some cases from GAI model or system inputs, and in other cases, \\nfrom GAI system outputs. Many GAI risks, however, originate from human behavior, including \\n \\n \\n3 “Algorithmic monocultures” refers to the phenomenon in which repeated use of the same model or algorithm in \\nconsequential decision-making settings like employment and lending can result in increased susceptibility by \\nsystems to correlated failures (like unexpected shocks), due to multiple actors relying on the same algorithm.  \\n4 Many studies have projected the impact of AI on the workforce and labor markets. Fewer studies have examined \\nthe impact of GAI on the labor market, though some industry surveys indicate that that both employees and \\nemployers are pondering this disruption.  \\n \\n3 \\nthe abuse, misuse, and unsafe repurposing by humans (adversarial or not), and others result \\nfrom interactions between a human and an AI system.  \\n• \\nTime scale: GAI risks may materialize abruptly or across extended periods. Examples include \\nimmediate (and/or prolonged) emotional harm and potential risks to physical safety due to the \\ndistribution of harmful deepfake images, or the long-term eﬀect of disinformation on societal \\ntrust in public institutions. \\nThe presence of risks and where they fall along the dimensions above will vary depending on the \\ncharacteristics of the GAI model, system, or use case at hand. These characteristics include but are not \\nlimited to GAI model or system architecture, training mechanisms and libraries, data types used for \\ntraining or ﬁne-tuning, levels of model access or availability of model weights, and application or use \\ncase context. \\nOrganizations may choose to tailor how they measure GAI risks based on these characteristics. They may \\nadditionally wish to allocate risk management resources relative to the severity and likelihood of \\nnegative impacts, including where and how these risks manifest, and their direct and material impacts \\nharms in the context of GAI use. Mitigations for model or system level risks may diﬀer from mitigations \\nfor use-case or ecosystem level risks. \\nImportantly, some GAI risks are unknown, and are therefore diﬃcult to properly scope or evaluate given \\nthe uncertainty about potential GAI scale, complexity, and capabilities. Other risks may be known but \\ndiﬃcult to estimate given the wide range of GAI stakeholders, uses, inputs, and outputs. Challenges with \\nrisk estimation are aggravated by a lack of visibility into GAI training data, and the generally immature \\nstate of the science of AI measurement and safety today. This document focuses on risks for which there \\nis an existing empirical evidence base at the time this proﬁle was written; for example, speculative risks \\nthat may potentially arise in more advanced, future GAI systems are not considered. Future updates may \\nincorporate additional risks or provide further details on the risks identiﬁed below. \\nTo guide organizations in identifying and managing GAI risks, a set of risks unique to or exacerbated by \\nthe development and use of GAI are deﬁned below.5 Each risk is labeled according to the outcome, \\nobject, or source of the risk (i.e., some are risks “to” a subject or domain and others are risks “of” or \\n“from” an issue or theme). These risks provide a lens through which organizations can frame and execute \\nrisk management eﬀorts. To help streamline risk management eﬀorts, each risk is mapped in Section 3 \\n(as well as in tables in Appendix B) to relevant Trustworthy AI Characteristics identiﬁed in the AI RMF.  \\n \\n \\n5 These risks can be further categorized by organizations depending on their unique approaches to risk deﬁnition \\nand management. One possible way to further categorize these risks, derived in part from the UK’s International \\nScientiﬁc Report on the Safety of Advanced AI, could be: 1) Technical / Model risks (or risk from malfunction): \\nConfabulation; Dangerous or Violent Recommendations; Data Privacy; Value Chain and Component Integration; \\nHarmful Bias, and Homogenization; 2) Misuse by humans (or malicious use): CBRN Information or Capabilities; \\nData Privacy; Human-AI Conﬁguration; Obscene, Degrading, and/or Abusive Content; Information Integrity; \\nInformation Security; 3) Ecosystem / societal risks (or systemic risks): Data Privacy; Environmental; Intellectual \\nProperty. We also note that some risks are cross-cutting between these categories.  \\n \\n4 \\n1. CBRN Information or Capabilities: Eased access to or synthesis of materially nefarious \\ninformation or design capabilities related to chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) \\nweapons or other dangerous materials or agents. \\n2. Confabulation: The production of conﬁdently stated but erroneous or false content (known \\ncolloquially as “hallucinations” or “fabrications”) by which users may be misled or deceived.6 \\n3. Dangerous, Violent, or Hateful Content: Eased production of and access to violent, inciting, \\nradicalizing, or threatening content as well as recommendations to carry out self-harm or \\nconduct illegal activities. Includes diﬃculty controlling public exposure to hateful and disparaging \\nor stereotyping content. \\n4. Data Privacy: Impacts due to leakage and unauthorized use, disclosure, or de-anonymization of \\nbiometric, health, location, or other personally identiﬁable information or sensitive data.7 \\n5. Environmental Impacts: Impacts due to high compute resource utilization in training or \\noperating GAI models, and related outcomes that may adversely impact ecosystems.  \\n6. Harmful Bias or Homogenization: Ampliﬁcation and exacerbation of historical, societal, and \\nsystemic biases; performance disparities8 between sub-groups or languages, possibly due to \\nnon-representative training data, that result in discrimination, ampliﬁcation of biases, or \\nincorrect presumptions about performance; undesired homogeneity that skews system or model \\noutputs, which may be erroneous, lead to ill-founded decision-making, or amplify harmful \\nbiases.  \\n7. Human-AI Conﬁguration: Arrangements of or interactions between a human and an AI system \\nwhich can result in the human inappropriately anthropomorphizing GAI systems or experiencing \\nalgorithmic aversion, automation bias, over-reliance, or emotional entanglement with GAI \\nsystems. \\n8. Information Integrity: Lowered barrier to entry to generate and support the exchange and \\nconsumption of content which may not distinguish fact from opinion or ﬁction or acknowledge \\nuncertainties, or could be leveraged for large-scale dis- and mis-information campaigns. \\n9. Information Security: Lowered barriers for oﬀensive cyber capabilities, including via automated \\ndiscovery and exploitation of vulnerabilities to ease hacking, malware, phishing, oﬀensive cyber \\n \\n \\n6 Some commenters have noted that the terms “hallucination” and “fabrication” anthropomorphize GAI, which \\nitself is a risk related to GAI systems as it can inappropriately attribute human characteristics to non-human \\nentities.  \\n7 What is categorized as sensitive data or sensitive PII can be highly contextual based on the nature of the \\ninformation, but examples of sensitive information include information that relates to an information subject’s \\nmost intimate sphere, including political opinions, sex life, or criminal convictions.  \\n8 The notion of harm presumes some baseline scenario that the harmful factor (e.g., a GAI model) makes worse. \\nWhen the mechanism for potential harm is a disparity between groups, it can be diﬃcult to establish what the \\nmost appropriate baseline is to compare against, which can result in divergent views on when a disparity between \\nAI behaviors for diﬀerent subgroups constitutes a harm. In discussing harms from disparities such as biased \\nbehavior, this document highlights examples where someone’s situation is worsened relative to what it would have \\nbeen in the absence of any AI system, making the outcome unambiguously a harm of the system.  \\n \\n5 \\noperations, or other cyberattacks; increased attack surface for targeted cyberattacks, which may \\ncompromise a system’s availability or the conﬁdentiality or integrity of training data, code, or \\nmodel weights.  \\n10. Intellectual Property: Eased production or replication of alleged copyrighted, trademarked, or \\nlicensed content without authorization (possibly in situations which do not fall under fair use); \\neased exposure of trade secrets; or plagiarism or illegal replication.  \\n11. Obscene, Degrading, and/or Abusive Content: Eased production of and access to obscene, \\ndegrading, and/or abusive imagery which can cause harm, including synthetic child sexual abuse \\nmaterial (CSAM), and nonconsensual intimate images (NCII) of adults. \\n12. Value Chain and Component Integration: Non-transparent or untraceable integration of \\nupstream third-party components, including data that has been improperly obtained or not \\nprocessed and cleaned due to increased automation from GAI; improper supplier vetting across \\nthe AI lifecycle; or other issues that diminish transparency or accountability for downstream \\nusers.

       " Document(metadata={'section': '\\n2.1. CBRN Information or Capabilities'}, page_content=' \\nIn the future, GAI may enable malicious actors to more easily access CBRN weapons and/or relevant \\nknowledge, information, materials, tools, or technologies that could be misused to assist in the design, \\ndevelopment, production, or use of CBRN weapons or other dangerous materials or agents. While \\nrelevant biological and chemical threat knowledge and information is often publicly accessible, LLMs \\ncould facilitate its analysis or synthesis, particularly by individuals without formal scientiﬁc training or \\nexpertise.  \\nRecent research on this topic found that LLM outputs regarding biological threat creation and attack \\nplanning provided minimal assistance beyond traditional search engine queries, suggesting that state-of-\\nthe-art LLMs at the time these studies were conducted do not substantially increase the operational \\nlikelihood of such an attack. The physical synthesis development, production, and use of chemical or \\nbiological agents will continue to require both applicable expertise and supporting materials and \\ninfrastructure. The impact of GAI on chemical or biological agent misuse will depend on what the key \\nbarriers for malicious actors are (e.g., whether information access is one such barrier), and how well GAI \\ncan help actors address those barriers.  \\nFurthermore, chemical and biological design tools (BDTs) – highly specialized AI systems trained on \\nscientiﬁc data that aid in chemical and biological design – may augment design capabilities in chemistry \\nand biology beyond what text-based LLMs are able to provide. As these models become more \\neﬃcacious, including for beneﬁcial uses, it will be important to assess their potential to be used for \\nharm, such as the ideation and design of novel harmful chemical or biological agents.  \\nWhile some of these described capabilities lie beyond the reach of existing GAI tools, ongoing \\nassessments of this risk would be enhanced by monitoring both the ability of AI tools to facilitate CBRN \\nweapons planning and GAI systems’ connection or access to relevant data and tools. \\nTrustworthy AI Characteristic: Safe, Explainable and Interpretable \\n \\n6 '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'section': '\\n2.2. Confabulation'}, page_content=' \\n“Confabulation” refers to a phenomenon in which GAI systems generate and conﬁdently present \\nerroneous or false content in response to prompts. Confabulations also include generated outputs that \\ndiverge from the prompts or other input or that contradict previously generated statements in the same \\ncontext. These phenomena are colloquially also referred to as “hallucinations” or “fabrications.” \\nConfabulations can occur across GAI outputs and contexts.9,10 Confabulations are a natural result of the \\nway generative models are designed: they generate outputs that approximate the statistical distribution \\nof their training data; for example, LLMs predict the next token or word in a sentence or phrase. While \\nsuch statistical prediction can produce factually accurate and consistent outputs, it can also produce \\noutputs that are factually inaccurate or internally inconsistent. This dynamic is particularly relevant when \\nit comes to open-ended prompts for long-form responses and in domains which require highly \\ncontextual and/or domain expertise.  \\nRisks from confabulations may arise when users believe false content – often due to the conﬁdent nature \\nof the response – leading users to act upon or promote the false information. This poses a challenge for \\nmany real-world applications, such as in healthcare, where a confabulated summary of patient \\ninformation reports could cause doctors to make incorrect diagnoses and/or recommend the wrong \\ntreatments. Risks of confabulated content may be especially important to monitor when integrating GAI \\ninto applications involving consequential decision making. \\nGAI outputs may also include confabulated logic or citations that purport to justify or explain the \\nsystem’s answer, which may further mislead humans into inappropriately trusting the system’s output. \\nFor instance, LLMs sometimes provide logical steps for how they arrived at an answer even when the \\nanswer itself is incorrect. Similarly, an LLM could falsely assert that it is human or has human traits, \\npotentially deceiving humans into believing they are speaking with another human. \\nThe extent to which humans can be deceived by LLMs, the mechanisms by which this may occur, and the \\npotential risks from adversarial prompting of such behavior are emerging areas of study. Given the wide \\nrange of downstream impacts of GAI, it is diﬃcult to estimate the downstream scale and impact of \\nconfabulations. \\nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Fair with Harmful Bias Managed, Safe, Valid and Reliable, Explainable \\nand Interpretable '),\n",

Dangerous, Violent, or Hateful Content'}, page_content=' \\nGAI systems can produce content that is inciting, radicalizing, or threatening, or that gloriﬁes violence, \\nwith greater ease and scale than other technologies. LLMs have been reported to generate dangerous or \\nviolent recommendations, and some models have generated actionable instructions for dangerous or \\n \\n \\n9 Confabulations of falsehoods are most commonly a problem for text-based outputs; for audio, image, or video \\ncontent, creative generation of non-factual content can be a desired behavior.  \\n10 For example, legal confabulations have been shown to be pervasive in current state-of-the-art LLMs. See also, \\ne.g.,  \\n \\n7 \\nunethical behavior. Text-to-image models also make it easy to create images that could be used to \\npromote dangerous or violent messages. Similar concerns are present for other GAI media, including \\nvideo and audio. GAI may also produce content that recommends self-harm or criminal/illegal activities.  \\nMany current systems restrict model outputs to limit certain content or in response to certain prompts, \\nbut this approach may still produce harmful recommendations in response to other less-explicit, novel \\nprompts (also relevant to CBRN Information or Capabilities, Data Privacy, Information Security, and \\nObscene, Degrading and/or Abusive Content). Crafting such prompts deliberately is known as \\n“jailbreaking,” or, manipulating prompts to circumvent output controls. Limitations of GAI systems can be \\nharmful or dangerous in certain contexts. Studies have observed that users may disclose mental health \\nissues in conversations with chatbots – and that users exhibit negative reactions to unhelpful responses \\nfrom these chatbots during situations of distress. \\nThis risk encompasses diﬃculty controlling creation of and public exposure to oﬀensive or hateful \\nlanguage, and denigrating or stereotypical content generated by AI. This kind of speech may contribute \\nto downstream harm such as fueling dangerous or violent behaviors. The spread of denigrating or \\nstereotypical content can also further exacerbate representational harms (see Harmful Bias and \\nHomogenization below).  \\nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Safe, Secure and Resilient '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'section': '\\n2.4. Data Privacy'}, page_content=' \\nGAI systems raise several risks to privacy. GAI system training requires large volumes of data, which in \\nsome cases may include personal data. The use of personal data for GAI training raises risks to widely \\naccepted privacy principles, including to transparency, individual participation (including consent), and \\npurpose speciﬁcation. For example, most model developers do not disclose speciﬁc data sources on \\nwhich models were trained, limiting user awareness of whether personally identiﬁably information (PII) \\nwas trained on and, if so, how it was collected.  \\nModels may leak, generate, or correctly infer sensitive information about individuals. For example, \\nduring adversarial attacks, LLMs have revealed sensitive information (from the public domain) that was \\nincluded in their training data. This problem has been referred to as data memorization, and may pose \\nexacerbated privacy risks even for data present only in a small number of training samples.  \\nIn addition to revealing sensitive information in GAI training data, GAI models may be able to correctly \\ninfer PII or sensitive data that was not in their training data nor disclosed by the user by stitching \\ntogether information from disparate sources. These inferences can have negative impact on an individual \\neven if the inferences are not accurate (e.g., confabulations), and especially if they reveal information \\nthat the individual considers sensitive or that is used to disadvantage or harm them. \\nBeyond harms from information exposure (such as extortion or dignitary harm), wrong or inappropriate \\ninferences of PII can contribute to downstream or secondary harmful impacts. For example, predictive \\ninferences made by GAI models based on PII or protected attributes can contribute to adverse decisions, \\nleading to representational or allocative harms to individuals or groups (see Harmful Bias and \\nHomogenization below).  \\n \\n8 \\nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Accountable and Transparent, Privacy Enhanced, Safe, Secure and \\nResilient '),\n",

In a study comparing energy consumption and carbon \\nemissions for LLM inference, generative tasks (e.g., text summarization) were found to be more energy- \\nand carbon-intensive than discriminative or non-generative tasks (e.g., text classiﬁcation).  \\nMethods for creating smaller versions of trained models, such as model distillation or compression, \\ncould reduce environmental impacts at inference time, but training and tuning such models may still \\ncontribute to their environmental impacts.

       " Document(metadata={'section': '\\n2.6. Harmful Bias and Homogenization'}, page_content=' \\nBias exists in many forms and can become ingrained in automated systems. AI systems, including GAI \\nsystems, can increase the speed and scale at which harmful biases manifest and are acted upon, \\npotentially perpetuating and amplifying harms to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and \\nsociety. For example, when prompted to generate images of CEOs, doctors, lawyers, and judges, current \\ntext-to-image models underrepresent women and/or racial minorities, and people with disabilities. \\nImage generator models have also produced biased or stereotyped output for various demographic \\ngroups and have diﬃculty producing non-stereotyped content even when the prompt speciﬁcally \\nrequests image features that are inconsistent with the stereotypes. Harmful bias in GAI models, which \\nmay stem from their training data, can also cause representational harms or perpetuate or exacerbate \\nbias based on race, gender, disability, or other protected classes.  \\nHarmful bias in GAI systems can also lead to harms via disparities between how a model performs for \\ndiﬀerent subgroups or languages (e.g., an LLM may perform less well for non-English languages or \\ncertain dialects). Such disparities can contribute to discriminatory decision-making or ampliﬁcation of \\nexisting societal biases. In addition, GAI systems may be inappropriately trusted to perform similarly \\nacross all subgroups, which could leave the groups facing underperformance with worse outcomes than \\nif no GAI system were used. Disparate or reduced performance for lower-resource languages also \\npresents challenges to model adoption, inclusion, and accessibility, and may make preservation of \\nendangered languages more diﬃcult if GAI systems become embedded in everyday processes that would \\notherwise have been opportunities to use these languages.  \\nBias is mutually reinforcing with the problem of undesired homogenization, in which GAI systems \\nproduce skewed distributions of outputs that are overly uniform (for example, repetitive aesthetic styles \\n \\n9 \\nand reduced content diversity). Overly homogenized outputs can themselves be incorrect, or they may \\nlead to unreliable decision-making or amplify harmful biases. These phenomena can ﬂow from \\nfoundation models to downstream models and systems, with the foundation models acting as \\n“bottlenecks,” or single points of failure.  \\nOverly homogenized content can contribute to “model collapse.” Model collapse can occur when model \\ntraining over-relies on synthetic data, resulting in data points disappearing from the distribution of the \\nnew model’s outputs. In addition to threatening the robustness of the model overall, model collapse \\ncould lead to homogenized outputs, including by amplifying any homogenization from the model used to \\ngenerate the synthetic training data. \\nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Fair with Harmful Bias Managed, Valid and Reliable \\n2.7. Human-AI Conﬁguration \\nGAI system use can involve varying risks of misconﬁgurations and poor interactions between a system \\nand a human who is interacting with it.

As a result, human experts may be unnecessarily “averse” to GAI systems, and thus \\ndeprive themselves or others of GAI’s beneﬁcial uses.  \\nConversely, due to the complexity and increasing reliability of GAI technology, over time, humans may \\nover-rely on GAI systems or may unjustiﬁably perceive GAI content to be of higher quality than that \\nproduced by other sources. This phenomenon is an example of automation bias, or excessive deference \\nto automated systems.

High-integrity \\ninformation is also accurate and reliable, can be veriﬁed and authenticated, has a clear chain of custody, \\nand creates reasonable expectations about when its validity may expire.”11 \\n \\n \\n11 This deﬁnition of information integrity is derived from the 2022 White House Roadmap for Researchers on \\nPriorities Related to Information Integrity Research and Development.  \\n \\n10 \\nGAI systems can ease the unintentional production or dissemination of false, inaccurate, or misleading \\ncontent (misinformation) at scale, particularly if the content stems from confabulations.  \\nGAI systems can also ease the deliberate production or dissemination of false or misleading information \\n(disinformation) at scale, where an actor has the explicit intent to deceive or cause harm to others. Even \\nvery subtle changes to text or images can manipulate human and machine perception. \\nSimilarly, GAI systems could enable a higher degree of sophistication for malicious actors to produce \\ndisinformation that is targeted towards speciﬁc demographics. Current and emerging multimodal models \\nmake it possible to generate both text-based disinformation and highly realistic “deepfakes” – that is, \\nsynthetic audiovisual content and photorealistic images.12 Additional disinformation threats could be \\nenabled by future GAI models trained on new data modalities. \\nDisinformation and misinformation – both of which may be facilitated by GAI – may erode public trust in \\ntrue or valid evidence and information, with downstream eﬀects. For example, a synthetic image of a \\nPentagon blast went viral and brieﬂy caused a drop in the stock market. Generative AI models can also \\nassist malicious actors in creating compelling imagery and propaganda to support disinformation \\ncampaigns, which may not be photorealistic, but could enable these campaigns to gain more reach and \\nengagement on social media platforms. Additionally, generative AI models can assist malicious actors in \\ncreating fraudulent content intended to impersonate others. \\nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Accountable and Transparent, Safe, Valid and Reliable, Interpretable and \\nExplainable '),\n",

Information Security'}, page_content=' \\nInformation security for computer systems and data is a mature ﬁeld with widely accepted and \\nstandardized practices for oﬀensive and defensive cyber capabilities. GAI-based systems present two \\nprimary information security risks: GAI could potentially discover or enable new cybersecurity risks by \\nlowering the barriers for or easing automated exercise of oﬀensive capabilities; simultaneously, it \\nexpands the available attack surface, as GAI itself is vulnerable to attacks like prompt injection or data \\npoisoning.  \\nOﬀensive cyber capabilities advanced by GAI systems may augment cybersecurity attacks such as \\nhacking, malware, and phishing. Reports have indicated that LLMs are already able to discover some \\nvulnerabilities in systems (hardware, software, data) and write code to exploit them. Sophisticated threat \\nactors might further these risks by developing GAI-powered security co-pilots for use in several parts of \\nthe attack chain, including informing attackers on how to proactively evade threat detection and escalate \\nprivileges after gaining system access. \\nInformation security for GAI models and systems also includes maintaining availability of the GAI system \\nand the integrity and (when applicable) the conﬁdentiality of the GAI code, training data, and model \\nweights. To identify and secure potential attack points in AI systems or speciﬁc components of the AI \\n \\n \\n12 See also https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AI.100-4, to be published. \\n \\n11 \\nvalue chain (e.g., data inputs, processing, GAI training, or deployment environments), conventional \\ncybersecurity practices may need to adapt or evolve. \\nFor instance, prompt injection involves modifying what input is provided to a GAI system so that it \\nbehaves in unintended ways. In direct prompt injections, attackers might craft malicious prompts and \\ninput them directly to a GAI system, with a variety of downstream negative consequences to \\ninterconnected systems. Indirect prompt injection attacks occur when adversaries remotely (i.e., without \\na direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by injecting prompts into data likely to be \\nretrieved. Security researchers have already demonstrated how indirect prompt injections can exploit \\nvulnerabilities by stealing proprietary data or running malicious code remotely on a machine. Merely \\nquerying a closed production model can elicit previously undisclosed information about that model. \\nAnother cybersecurity risk to GAI is data poisoning, in which an adversary compromises a training \\ndataset used by a model to manipulate its outputs or operation. Malicious tampering with data or parts \\nof the model could exacerbate risks associated with GAI system outputs. \\nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Privacy Enhanced, Safe, Secure and Resilient, Valid and Reliable '),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'section': 'Appendix A. Primary GAI Considerations'}, page_content=' \\nThe following primary considerations were derived as overarching themes from the GAI PWG \\nconsultation process. These considerations (Governance, Pre-Deployment Testing, Content Provenance, \\nand Incident Disclosure) are relevant for voluntary use by any organization designing, developing, and \\nusing GAI and also inform the Actions to Manage GAI risks. Information included about the primary \\nconsiderations is not exhaustive, but highlights the most relevant topics derived from the GAI PWG.  \\nAcknowledgments: These considerations could not have been surfaced without the helpful analysis and \\ncontributions from the community and NIST staﬀ GAI PWG leads: George Awad, Luca Belli, Harold Booth, \\nMat Heyman, Yooyoung Lee, Mark Pryzbocki, Reva Schwartz, Martin Stanley, and Kyra Yee. \\nA.1. Governance \\nA.1.1. Overview \\nLike any other technology system, governance principles and techniques can be used to manage risks \\nrelated to generative AI models, capabilities, and applications. Organizations may choose to apply their \\nexisting risk tiering to GAI systems, or they may opt to revise or update AI system risk levels to address \\nthese unique GAI risks. This section describes how organizational governance regimes may be re-\\nevaluated and adjusted for GAI contexts. It also addresses third-party considerations for governing across \\nthe AI value chain.  \\nA.1.2. Organizational Governance \\nGAI opportunities, risks and long-term performance characteristics are typically less well-understood \\nthan non-generative AI tools and may be perceived and acted upon by humans in ways that vary greatly. \\nAccordingly, GAI may call for diﬀerent levels of oversight from AI Actors or diﬀerent human-AI \\nconﬁgurations in order to manage their risks eﬀectively. Organizations’ use of GAI systems may also \\nwarrant additional human review, tracking and documentation, and greater management oversight.  \\nAI technology can produce varied outputs in multiple modalities and present many classes of user \\ninterfaces. This leads to a broader set of AI Actors interacting with GAI systems for widely diﬀering \\napplications and contexts of use. These can include data labeling and preparation, development of GAI \\nmodels, content moderation, code generation and review, text generation and editing, image and video \\ngeneration, summarization, search, and chat. These activities can take place within organizational \\nsettings or in the public domain. \\nOrganizations can restrict AI applications that cause harm, exceed stated risk tolerances, or that conﬂict \\nwith their tolerances or values. Governance tools and protocols that are applied to other types of AI \\nsystems can be applied to GAI systems. These plans and actions include: \\n• Accessibility and reasonable \\naccommodations \\n• AI actor credentials and qualiﬁcations  \\n• Alignment to organizational values \\n• Auditing and assessment \\n• Change-management controls \\n• Commercial use \\n• Data provenance \\n \\n48 \\n• Data protection \\n• Data retention  \\n• Consistency in use of deﬁning key terms \\n• Decommissioning \\n• Discouraging anonymous use \\n• Education  \\n• Impact assessments  \\n• Incident response \\n• Monitoring \\n• Opt-outs  \\n• Risk-based controls \\n• Risk mapping and measurement \\n• Science-backed TEVV practices \\n• Secure software development practices \\n• Stakeholder engagement \\n• Synthetic content detection and \\nlabeling tools and techniques \\n• Whistleblower protections \\n• Workforce diversity and \\ninterdisciplinary teams\\nEstablishing acceptable use policies and guidance for the use of GAI in formal human-AI teaming settings \\nas well as diﬀerent levels of human-AI conﬁgurations can help to decrease risks arising from misuse, \\nabuse, inappropriate repurpose, and misalignment between systems and users. These practices are just \\none example of adapting existing governance protocols for GAI contexts.  \\nA.1.3. Third-Party Considerations \\nOrganizations may seek to acquire, embed, incorporate, or use open-source or proprietary third-party \\nGAI models, systems, or generated data for various applications across an enterprise. Use of these GAI \\ntools and inputs has implications for all functions of the organization – including but not limited to \\nacquisition, human resources, legal, compliance, and IT services – regardless of whether they are carried \\nout by employees or third parties. Many of the actions cited above are relevant and options for \\naddressing third-party considerations. \\nThird party GAI integrations may give rise to increased intellectual property, data privacy, or information \\nsecurity risks, pointing to the need for clear guidelines for transparency and risk management regarding \\nthe collection and use of third-party data for model inputs. Organizations may consider varying risk \\ncontrols for foundation models, ﬁne-tuned models, and embedded tools, enhanced processes for \\ninteracting with external GAI technologies or service providers. Organizations can apply standard or \\nexisting risk controls and processes to proprietary or open-source GAI technologies, data, and third-party \\nservice providers, including acquisition and procurement due diligence, requests for software bills of \\nmaterials (SBOMs), application of service level agreements (SLAs), and statement on standards for \\nattestation engagement (SSAE) reports to help with third-party transparency and risk management for \\nGAI systems. \\nA.1.4. Pre-Deployment Testing \\nOverview \\nThe diverse ways and contexts in which GAI systems may be developed, used, and repurposed \\ncomplicates risk mapping and pre-deployment measurement eﬀorts. Robust test, evaluation, validation, \\nand veriﬁcation (TEVV) processes can be iteratively applied – and documented – in early stages of the AI \\nlifecycle and informed by representative AI Actors (see Figure 3 of the AI RMF). Until new and rigorous \\n \\n49 \\nearly lifecycle TEVV approaches are developed and matured for GAI, organizations may use \\nrecommended “pre-deployment testing” practices to measure performance, capabilities, limits, risks, \\nand impacts. This section describes risk measurement and estimation as part of pre-deployment TEVV, \\nand examines the state of play for pre-deployment testing methodologies.  \\nLimitations of Current Pre-deployment Test Approaches \\nCurrently available pre-deployment TEVV processes used for GAI applications may be inadequate, non-\\nsystematically applied, or fail to reﬂect or mismatched to deployment contexts. For example, the \\nanecdotal testing of GAI system capabilities through video games or standardized tests designed for \\nhumans (e.g., intelligence tests, professional licensing exams) does not guarantee GAI system validity or \\nreliability in those domains. Similarly, jailbreaking or prompt engineering tests may not systematically \\nassess validity or reliability risks.  \\nMeasurement gaps can arise from mismatches between laboratory and real-world settings. Current \\ntesting approaches often remain focused on laboratory conditions or restricted to benchmark test \\ndatasets and in silico techniques that may not extrapolate well to—or directly assess GAI impacts in real-\\nworld conditions. For example, current measurement gaps for GAI make it diﬃcult to precisely estimate \\nits potential ecosystem-level or longitudinal risks and related political, social, and economic impacts. \\nGaps between benchmarks and real-world use of GAI systems may likely be exacerbated due to prompt \\nsensitivity and broad heterogeneity of contexts of use. \\nA.1.5. Structured Public Feedback \\nStructured public feedback can be used to evaluate whether GAI systems are performing as intended \\nand to calibrate and verify traditional measurement methods. Examples of structured feedback include, \\nbut are not limited to: \\n• \\nParticipatory Engagement Methods: Methods used to solicit feedback from civil society groups, \\naﬀected communities, and users, including focus groups, small user studies, and surveys. \\n• \\nField Testing: Methods used to determine how people interact with, consume, use, and make \\nsense of AI-generated information, and subsequent actions and eﬀects, including UX, usability, \\nand other structured, randomized experiments.  \\n• \\nAI Red-teaming: A structured testing exercise used to probe an AI system to ﬁnd ﬂaws and \\nvulnerabilities such as inaccurate, harmful, or discriminatory outputs, often in a controlled \\nenvironment and in collaboration with system developers. \\nInformation gathered from structured public feedback can inform design, implementation, deployment \\napproval, maintenance, or decommissioning decisions. Results and insights gleaned from these exercises \\ncan serve multiple purposes, including improving data quality and preprocessing, bolstering governance \\ndecision making, and enhancing system documentation and debugging practices. When implementing \\nfeedback activities, organizations should follow human subjects research requirements and best \\npractices such as informed consent and subject compensation. \\n \\n50 \\nParticipatory Engagement Methods \\nOn an ad hoc or more structured basis, organizations can design and use a variety of channels to engage \\nexternal stakeholders in product development or review. Focus groups with select experts can provide \\nfeedback on a range of issues. Small user studies can provide feedback from representative groups or \\npopulations. Anonymous surveys can be used to poll or gauge reactions to speciﬁc features. Participatory \\nengagement methods are often less structured than ﬁeld testing or red teaming, and are more \\ncommonly used in early stages of AI or product development.  \\nField Testing \\nField testing involves structured settings to evaluate risks and impacts and to simulate the conditions \\nunder which the GAI system will be deployed. Field style tests can be adapted from a focus on user \\npreferences and experiences towards AI risks and impacts – both negative and positive. When carried \\nout with large groups of users, these tests can provide estimations of the likelihood of risks and impacts \\nin real world interactions. \\nOrganizations may also collect feedback on outcomes, harms, and user experience directly from users in \\nthe production environment after a model has been released, in accordance with human subject \\nstandards such as informed consent and compensation. Organizations should follow applicable human \\nsubjects research requirements, and best practices such as informed consent and subject compensation, \\nwhen implementing feedback activities. \\nAI Red-teaming \\nAI red-teaming is an evolving practice that references exercises often conducted in a controlled \\nenvironment and in collaboration with AI developers building AI models to identify potential adverse \\nbehavior or outcomes of a GAI model or system, how they could occur, and stress test safeguards”. AI \\nred-teaming can be performed before or after AI models or systems are made available to the broader \\npublic; this section focuses on red-teaming in pre-deployment contexts.  \\nThe quality of AI red-teaming outputs is related to the background and expertise of the AI red team \\nitself. Demographically and interdisciplinarily diverse AI red teams can be used to identify ﬂaws in the \\nvarying contexts where GAI will be used. For best results, AI red teams should demonstrate domain \\nexpertise, and awareness of socio-cultural aspects within the deployment context. AI red-teaming results \\nshould be given additional analysis before they are incorporated into organizational governance and \\ndecision making, policy and procedural updates, and AI risk management eﬀorts. \\nVarious types of AI red-teaming may be appropriate, depending on the use case: \\n• \\nGeneral Public: Performed by general users (not necessarily AI or technical experts) who are \\nexpected to use the model or interact with its outputs, and who bring their own lived \\nexperiences and perspectives to the task of AI red-teaming. These individuals may have been \\nprovided instructions and material to complete tasks which may elicit harmful model behaviors. \\nThis type of exercise can be more eﬀective with large groups of AI red-teamers. \\n• \\nExpert: Performed by specialists with expertise in the domain or speciﬁc AI red-teaming context \\nof use (e.g., medicine, biotech, cybersecurity).  \\n• \\nCombination: In scenarios when it is diﬃcult to identify and recruit specialists with suﬃcient \\ndomain and contextual expertise, AI red-teaming exercises may leverage both expert and \\n \\n51 \\ngeneral public participants. For example, expert AI red-teamers could modify or verify the \\nprompts written by general public AI red-teamers. These approaches may also expand coverage \\nof the AI risk attack surface.  \\n• \\nHuman / AI: Performed by GAI in combination with specialist or non-specialist human teams. \\nGAI-led red-teaming can be more cost eﬀective than human red-teamers alone. Human or GAI-\\nled AI red-teaming may be better suited for eliciting diﬀerent types of harms. \\n \\nA.1.6. Content Provenance \\nOverview \\nGAI technologies can be leveraged for many applications such as content generation and synthetic data. \\nSome aspects of GAI outputs, such as the production of deepfake content, can challenge our ability to \\ndistinguish human-generated content from AI-generated synthetic content. To help manage and mitigate \\nthese risks, digital transparency mechanisms like provenance data tracking can trace the origin and \\nhistory of content. Provenance data tracking and synthetic content detection can help facilitate greater \\ninformation access about both authentic and synthetic content to users, enabling better knowledge of \\ntrustworthiness in AI systems. When combined with other organizational accountability mechanisms, \\ndigital content transparency approaches can enable processes to trace negative outcomes back to their \\nsource, improve information integrity, and uphold public trust. Provenance data tracking and synthetic \\ncontent detection mechanisms provide information about the origin and history of content to assist in \\nGAI risk management eﬀorts. \\nProvenance metadata can include information about GAI model developers or creators of GAI content, \\ndate/time of creation, location, modiﬁcations, and sources. Metadata can be tracked for text, images, \\nvideos, audio, and underlying datasets. The implementation of provenance data tracking techniques can \\nhelp assess the authenticity, integrity, intellectual property rights, and potential manipulations in digital \\ncontent. Some well-known techniques for provenance data tracking include digital watermarking, \\nmetadata recording, digital ﬁngerprinting, and human authentication, among others. \\nProvenance Data Tracking Approaches \\nProvenance data tracking techniques for GAI systems can be used to track the history and origin of data \\ninputs, metadata, and synthetic content. Provenance data tracking records the origin and history for \\ndigital content, allowing its authenticity to be determined. It consists of techniques to record metadata \\nas well as overt and covert digital watermarks on content. Data provenance refers to tracking the origin \\nand history of input data through metadata and digital watermarking techniques. Provenance data \\ntracking processes can include and assist AI Actors across the lifecycle who may not have full visibility or \\ncontrol over the various trade-oﬀs and cascading impacts of early-stage model decisions on downstream \\nperformance and synthetic outputs. For example, by selecting a watermarking model to prioritize \\nrobustness (the durability of a watermark), an AI actor may inadvertently diminish computational \\ncomplexity (the resources required to implement watermarking). Organizational risk management \\neﬀorts for enhancing content provenance include:  \\n• \\nTracking provenance of training data and metadata for GAI systems; \\n• \\nDocumenting provenance data limitations within GAI systems; \\n \\n52 \\n• \\nMonitoring system capabilities and limitations in deployment through rigorous TEVV processes; \\n• \\nEvaluating how humans engage, interact with, or adapt to GAI content (especially in decision \\nmaking tasks informed by GAI content), and how they react to applied provenance techniques \\nsuch as overt disclosures. \\nOrganizations can document and delineate GAI system objectives and limitations to identify gaps where \\nprovenance data may be most useful. For instance, GAI systems used for content creation may require \\nrobust watermarking techniques and corresponding detectors to identify the source of content or \\nmetadata recording techniques and metadata management tools and repositories to trace content \\norigins and modiﬁcations. Further narrowing of GAI task deﬁnitions to include provenance data can \\nenable organizations to maximize the utility of provenance data and risk management eﬀorts. \\nA.1.7. Enhancing Content Provenance through Structured Public Feedback \\nWhile indirect feedback methods such as automated error collection systems are useful, they often lack \\nthe context and depth that direct input from end users can provide. Organizations can leverage feedback \\napproaches described in the Pre-Deployment Testing section to capture input from external sources such \\nas through AI red-teaming.  \\nIntegrating pre- and post-deployment external feedback into the monitoring process for GAI models and \\ncorresponding applications can help enhance awareness of performance changes and mitigate potential \\nrisks and harms from outputs. There are many ways to capture and make use of user feedback – before \\nand after GAI systems and digital content transparency approaches are deployed – to gain insights about \\nauthentication eﬃcacy and vulnerabilities, impacts of adversarial threats on techniques, and unintended \\nconsequences resulting from the utilization of content provenance approaches on users and \\ncommunities. Furthermore, organizations can track and document the provenance of datasets to identify \\ninstances in which AI-generated data is a potential root cause of performance issues with the GAI \\nsystem. \\nA.1.8. Incident Disclosure \\nOverview \\nAI incidents can be deﬁned as an “event, circumstance, or series of events where the development, use, \\nor malfunction of one or more AI systems directly or indirectly contributes to one of the following harms: \\ninjury or harm to the health of a person or groups of people (including psychological harms and harms to \\nmental health); disruption of the management and operation of critical infrastructure; violations of \\nhuman rights or a breach of obligations under applicable law intended to protect fundamental, labor, \\nand intellectual property rights; or harm to property, communities, or the environment.” AI incidents can \\noccur in the aggregate (i.e., for systemic discrimination) or acutely (i.e., for one individual). \\nState of AI Incident Tracking and Disclosure \\nFormal channels do not currently exist to report and document AI incidents. However, a number of \\npublicly available databases have been created to document their occurrence. These reporting channels \\nmake decisions on an ad hoc basis about what kinds of incidents to track. Some, for example, track by \\namount of media coverage.  \\n \\n53 \\nDocumenting, reporting, and sharing information about GAI incidents can help mitigate and prevent \\nharmful outcomes by assisting relevant AI Actors in tracing impacts to their source. Greater awareness \\nand standardization of GAI incident reporting could promote this transparency and improve GAI risk \\nmanagement across the AI ecosystem.  \\nDocumentation and Involvement of AI Actors \\nAI Actors should be aware of their roles in reporting AI incidents. To better understand previous incidents \\nand implement measures to prevent similar ones in the future, organizations could consider developing \\nguidelines for publicly available incident reporting which include information about AI actor \\nresponsibilities. These guidelines would help AI system operators identify GAI incidents across the AI \\nlifecycle and with AI Actors regardless of role. Documentation and review of third-party inputs and \\nplugins for GAI systems is especially important for AI Actors in the context of incident disclosure; LLM \\ninputs and content delivered through these plugins is often distributed, with inconsistent or insuﬃcient \\naccess control. \\nDocumentation practices including logging, recording, and analyzing GAI incidents can facilitate \\nsmoother sharing of information with relevant AI Actors. Regular information sharing, change \\nmanagement records, version history and metadata can also empower AI Actors responding to and \\nmanaging AI incidents.  \\n \\n \\n54 \\n'),\n",

A proﬁle is an implementation of the AI RMF functions, categories, and subcategories for a speciﬁc \\nsetting, application, or technology – in this case, Generative AI (GAI) – based on the requirements, risk \\ntolerance, and resources of the Framework user. AI RMF proﬁles assist organizations in deciding how to \\nbest manage AI risks in a manner that is well-aligned with their goals, considers legal/regulatory \\nrequirements and best practices, and reﬂects risk management priorities. Consistent with other AI RMF \\nproﬁles, this proﬁle oﬀers insights into how risk can be managed across various stages of the AI lifecycle \\nand for GAI as a technology. As GAI covers risks of models or applications that can be used across use cases or sectors, this document \\nis an AI RMF cross-sectoral proﬁle. Cross-sectoral proﬁles can be used to govern, map, measure, and \\nmanage risks associated with activities or business processes common across sectors, such as the use of \\nlarge language models (LLMs), cloud-based services, or acquisition. This document deﬁnes risks that are novel to or exacerbated by the use of GAI. After introducing and \\ndescribing these risks, the document provides a set of suggested actions to help organizations govern, \\nmap, measure, and manage these risks. 1 EO 14110 deﬁnes Generative AI as “the class of AI models that emulate the structure and characteristics of input \\ndata in order to generate derived synthetic content. This can include images, videos, audio, text, and other digital \\ncontent.” While not all GAI is derived from foundation models, for purposes of this document, GAI generally refers \\nto generative foundation models. The foundation model subcategory of “dual-use foundation models” is deﬁned by \\nEO 14110 as “an AI model that is trained on broad data; generally uses self-supervision; contains at least tens of \\nbillions of parameters; is applicable across a wide range of contexts.”  \\n2 This proﬁle was developed per Section 4.1(a)(i)(A) of EO 14110, which directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting \\nthrough the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to develop a companion \\nresource to the AI RMF, NIST AI 100–1, for generative AI. 2 \\nThis work was informed by public feedback and consultations with diverse stakeholder groups as part of NIST’s \\nGenerative AI Public Working Group (GAI PWG). The GAI PWG was an open, transparent, and collaborative \\nprocess, facilitated via a virtual workspace, to obtain multistakeholder input on GAI risk management and to \\ninform NIST’s approach. The focus of the GAI PWG was limited to four primary considerations relevant to GAI: Governance, Content \\nProvenance, Pre-deployment Testing, and Incident Disclosure (further described in Appendix A). As such, the \\nsuggested actions in this document primarily address these considerations. Future revisions of this proﬁle will include additional AI RMF subcategories, risks, and suggested actions based \\non additional considerations of GAI as the space evolves and empirical evidence indicates additional risks. A \\nglossary of terms pertinent to GAI risk management will be developed and hosted on NIST’s Trustworthy & \\nResponsible AI Resource Center (AIRC), and added to The Language of Trustworthy AI: An In-Depth Glossary of \\nTerms.

These principles—while taking into account the sensitive law enforcement and other contexts in which \\nthe federal government may use AI, as opposed to private sector use of AI—require that AI is: (a) lawful and \\nrespectful of our Nation’s values; (b) purposeful and performance-driven; (c) accurate, reliable, and effective; (d) \\nsafe, secure, and resilient; (e) understandable; (f ) responsible and traceable; (g) regularly monitored; (h) transpar-\\nent; and, (i) accountable. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is consistent with the Executive Order. Affected agencies across the federal government have released AI use case inventories13 and are implementing \\nplans to bring those AI systems into compliance with the Executive Order or retire them. The law and policy landscape for motor vehicles shows that strong safety regulations—and \\nmeasures to address harms when they occur—can enhance innovation in the context of com-\\nplex technologies. Cars, like automated digital systems, comprise a complex collection of components. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,14 through its rigorous standards and independent \\nevaluation, helps make sure vehicles on our roads are safe without limiting manufacturers’ ability to \\ninnovate.15 At the same time, rules of the road are implemented locally to impose contextually appropriate \\nrequirements on drivers, such as slowing down near schools or playgrounds.16\\nFrom large companies to start-ups, industry is providing innovative solutions that allow \\norganizations to mitigate risks to the safety and efficacy of AI systems, both before \\ndeployment and through monitoring over time.17 These innovative solutions include risk \\nassessments, auditing mechanisms, assessment of organizational procedures, dashboards to allow for ongoing \\nmonitoring, documentation procedures specific to model assessments, and many other strategies that aim to \\nmitigate risks posed by the use of AI to companies’ reputation, legal responsibilities, and other product safety \\nand effectiveness concerns. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has called for an expansion of opportunities \\nfor meaningful stakeholder engagement in the design of programs and services. OMB also \\npoints to numerous examples of effective and proactive stakeholder engagement, including the Community-\\nBased Participatory Research Program developed by the National Institutes of Health and the participatory \\ntechnology assessments developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.18\\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing a risk \\nmanagement framework to better manage risks posed to individuals, organizations, and \\nsociety by AI.19 The NIST AI Risk Management Framework, as mandated by Congress, is intended for \\nvoluntary use to help incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and \\nevaluation of AI products, services, and systems. The NIST framework is being developed through a consensus-\\ndriven, open, transparent, and collaborative process that includes workshops and other opportunities to provide \\ninput. The NIST framework aims to foster the development of innovative approaches to address \\ncharacteristics of trustworthiness including accuracy, explainability and interpretability, reliability, privacy, \\nrobustness, safety, security (resilience), and mitigation of unintended and/or harmful bias, as well as of \\nharmful \\nuses.

Primary GAI Considerations', '_id': '79ad3cde0f98496b98f0ff7e172136e7', '_collection_name': 'alt_ai_policy'}, page_content='Governance \\nA.1.1. Overview \\nLike any other technology system, governance principles and techniques can be used to manage risks \\nrelated to generative AI models, capabilities, and applications. Organizations may choose to apply their \\nexisting risk tiering to GAI systems, or they may opt to revise or update AI system risk levels to address \\nthese unique GAI risks. This section describes how organizational governance regimes may be re-\\nevaluated and adjusted for GAI contexts. It also addresses third-party considerations for governing across \\nthe AI value chain. A.1.2. Organizational Governance \\nGAI opportunities, risks and long-term performance characteristics are typically less well-understood \\nthan non-generative AI tools and may be perceived and acted upon by humans in ways that vary greatly. Accordingly, GAI may call for diﬀerent levels of oversight from AI Actors or diﬀerent human-AI \\nconﬁgurations in order to manage their risks eﬀectively. Organizations’ use of GAI systems may also \\nwarrant additional human review, tracking and documentation, and greater management oversight. AI technology can produce varied outputs in multiple modalities and present many classes of user \\ninterfaces. This leads to a broader set of AI Actors interacting with GAI systems for widely diﬀering \\napplications and contexts of use. These can include data labeling and preparation, development of GAI \\nmodels, content moderation, code generation and review, text generation and editing, image and video \\ngeneration, summarization, search, and chat. These activities can take place within organizational \\nsettings or in the public domain. Organizations can restrict AI applications that cause harm, exceed stated risk tolerances, or that conﬂict \\nwith their tolerances or values. Governance tools and protocols that are applied to other types of AI \\nsystems can be applied to GAI systems.
