This technical companion considers each principle in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and \nprovides examples and concrete steps for communities, industry, governments, and others to take in order to \nbuild these protections into policy, practice, or the technological design process. Taken together, the technical protections and practices laid out in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights can help \nguard the American public against many of the potential and actual harms identified by researchers, technolo\u00ad\ngists, advocates, journalists, policymakers, and communities in the United States and around the world. This \ntechnical companion is intended to be used as a reference by people across many circumstances \u2013 anyone \nimpacted by automated systems, and anyone developing, designing, deploying, evaluating, or making policy to \ngovern the use of an automated system. Each principle is accompanied by three supplemental sections: \n1\n2\nWHY THIS PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANT: \nThis section provides a brief summary of the problems that the principle seeks to address and protect against, including \nillustrative examples. WHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS: \n\u2022 The expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional technical\nstandards and practices that should be tailored for particular sectors and contexts. \u2022 This section outlines practical steps that can be implemented to realize the vision of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. The \nexpectations laid out often mirror existing practices for technology development, including pre-deployment testing, ongoing \nmonitoring, and governance structures for automated systems, but also go further to address unmet needs for change and offer \nconcrete directions for how those changes can be made. \u2022 Expectations about reporting are intended for the entity developing or using the automated system. The resulting reports can \nbe provided to the public, regulators, auditors, industry standards groups, or others engaged in independent review, and should \nbe made public as much as possible consistent with law, regulation, and policy, and noting that intellectual property, law \nenforcement, or national security considerations may prevent public release. Where public reports are not possible, the \ninformation should be provided to oversight bodies and privacy, civil liberties, or other ethics officers charged with safeguard \ning individuals\u2019 rights. These reporting expectations are important for transparency, so the American people can have\nconfidence that their rights, opportunities, and access as well as their expectations about technologies are respected. 3\nHOW THESE PRINCIPLES CAN MOVE INTO PRACTICE: \nThis section provides real-life examples of how these guiding principles can become reality, through laws, policies, and practices. It describes practical technical and sociotechnical approaches to protecting rights, opportunities, and access. The examples provided are not critiques or endorsements, but rather are offered as illustrative cases to help \nprovide a concrete vision for actualizing the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. Effectively implementing these \nprocesses require the cooperation of and collaboration among industry, civil society, researchers, policymakers, \ntechnologists, and the public.", "type": "Document"}

These principles\u2014while taking into account the sensitive law enforcement and other contexts in which \nthe federal government may use AI, as opposed to private sector use of AI\u2014require that AI is: (a) lawful and \nrespectful of our Nation\u2019s values; (b) purposeful and performance-driven; (c) accurate, reliable, and effective; (d) \nsafe, secure, and resilient; (e) understandable; (f ) responsible and traceable; (g) regularly monitored; (h) transpar-\nent; and, (i) accountable. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is consistent with the Executive Order. Affected agencies across the federal government have released AI use case inventories13 and are implementing \nplans to bring those AI systems into compliance with the Executive Order or retire them.

Cars, like automated digital systems, comprise a complex collection of components. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,14 through its rigorous standards and independent \nevaluation, helps make sure vehicles on our roads are safe without limiting manufacturers\u2019 ability to \ninnovate.15 At the same time, rules of the road are implemented locally to impose contextually appropriate \nrequirements on drivers, such as slowing down near schools or playgrounds.16\nFrom large companies to start-ups, industry is providing innovative solutions that allow \norganizations to mitigate risks to the safety and efficacy of AI systems, both before \ndeployment and through monitoring over time.17 These innovative solutions include risk \nassessments, auditing mechanisms, assessment of organizational procedures, dashboards to allow for ongoing \nmonitoring, documentation procedures specific to model assessments, and many other strategies that aim to \nmitigate risks posed by the use of AI to companies\u2019 reputation, legal responsibilities, and other product safety \nand effectiveness concerns. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has called for an expansion of opportunities \nfor meaningful stakeholder engagement in the design of programs and services. OMB also \npoints to numerous examples of effective and proactive stakeholder engagement, including the Community-\nBased Participatory Research Program developed by the National Institutes of Health and the participatory \ntechnology assessments developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.18\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing a risk \nmanagement framework to better manage risks posed to individuals, organizations, and \nsociety by AI.19 The NIST AI Risk Management Framework, as mandated by Congress, is intended for \nvoluntary use to help incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and \nevaluation of AI products, services, and systems. The NIST framework is being developed through a consensus-\ndriven, open, transparent, and collaborative process that includes workshops and other opportunities to provide \ninput.

The Privacy Act of 1974 requires privacy protections for personal information in federal \nrecords systems, including limits on data retention, and also provides individuals a general \nright to access and correct their data. Among other things, the Privacy Act limits the storage of individual \ninformation in federal systems of records, illustrating the principle of limiting the scope of data retention. Under \nthe Privacy Act, federal agencies may only retain data about an individual that is \u201crelevant and necessary\u201d to \naccomplish an agency\u2019s statutory purpose or to comply with an Executive Order of the President. The law allows \nfor individuals to be able to access any of their individual information stored in a federal system of records, if not \nincluded under one of the systems of records exempted pursuant to the Privacy Act. In these cases, federal agen\u00ad\ncies must provide a method for an individual to determine if their personal information is stored in a particular \nsystem of records, and must provide procedures for an individual to contest the contents of a record about them. Further, the Privacy Act allows for a cause of action for an individual to seek legal relief if a federal agency does not \ncomply with the Privacy Act\u2019s requirements. Among other things, a court may order a federal agency to amend or \ncorrect an individual\u2019s information in its records or award monetary damages if an inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, \nor incomplete record results in an adverse determination about an individual\u2019s \u201cqualifications, character, rights, \u2026 \nopportunities\u2026, or benefits.\u201d \nNIST\u2019s Privacy Framework provides a comprehensive, detailed and actionable approach for \norganizations to manage privacy risks.

It has been voluntarily adopted by organizations across many different sectors around the world.78\nA school board\u2019s attempt to surveil public school students\u2014undertaken without \nadequate community input\u2014sparked a state-wide biometrics moratorium.79 Reacting to a plan in \nthe city of Lockport, New York, the state\u2019s legislature banned the use of facial recognition systems and other \n\u201cbiometric identifying technology\u201d in schools until July 1, 2022.80 The law additionally requires that a report on \nthe privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties implications of the use of such technologies be issued before \nbiometric identification technologies can be used in New York schools.

For example, a collection of non-profit organizations and companies have \nworked together to develop a framework that defines operational approaches to transparency for machine \nlearning systems.88 This framework, and others like it,89 inform the public about the use of these tools, going \nbeyond simple notice to include reporting elements such as safety evaluations, disparity assessments, and \nexplanations of how the systems work.

Both the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act require in certain circumstances \nthat consumers who are denied credit receive \"adverse action\" notices. Anyone who relies on the information in a \ncredit report to deny a consumer credit must, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, provide an \"adverse action\" \nnotice to the consumer, which includes \"notice of the reasons a creditor took adverse action on the application \nor on an existing credit account.\"90 In addition, under the risk-based pricing rule,91 lenders must either inform \nborrowers of their credit score, or else tell consumers when \"they are getting worse terms because of \ninformation in their credit report.\" The CFPB has also asserted that \"[t]he law gives every applicant the right to \na specific explanation if their application for credit was denied, and that right is not diminished simply because \na company uses a complex algorithm that it doesn't understand.\"92 Such explanations illustrate a shared value \nthat certain decisions need to be explained.

There are many reasons people may prefer not to use an automated system: the system can be flawed and can lead to \nunintended outcomes; it may reinforce bias or be inaccessible; it may simply be inconvenient or unavailable; or it may \nreplace a paper or manual process to which people had grown accustomed. Yet members of the public are often \npresented with no alternative, or are forced to endure a cumbersome process to reach a human decision-maker once \nthey decide they no longer want to deal exclusively with the automated system or be impacted by its results. As a result \nof this lack of human reconsideration, many receive delayed access, or lose access, to rights, opportunities, benefits, \nand critical services. The American public deserves the assurance that, when rights, opportunities, or access are \nmeaningfully at stake and there is a reasonable expectation of an alternative to an automated system, they can conve\u00ad\nniently opt out of an automated system and will not be disadvantaged for that choice. In some cases, such a human or \nother alternative may be required by law, for example it could be required as \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for people \nwith disabilities. In addition to being able to opt out and use a human alternative, the American public deserves a human fallback \nsystem in the event that an automated system fails or causes harm. No matter how rigorously an automated system is \ntested, there will always be situations for which the system fails. The American public deserves protection via human \nreview against these outlying or unexpected scenarios. In the case of time-critical systems, the public should not have \nto wait\u2014immediate human consideration and fallback should be available. In many time-critical systems, such a \nremedy is already immediately available, such as a building manager who can open a door in the case an automated \ncard access system fails. In the criminal justice system, employment, education, healthcare, and other sensitive domains, automated systems \nare used for many purposes, from pre-trial risk assessments and parole decisions to technologies that help doctors \ndiagnose disease.

Throughout, many of the panelists individually emphasized that the impact of these systems on \nindividuals and communities is potentially severe: the systems lack individualization and work against the \nbelief that people can change for the better, system use can lead to the loss of jobs and custody of children, and \nsurveillance can lead to chilling effects for communities and sends negative signals to community members \nabout how they're viewed. In discussion of technical and governance interventions that that are needed to protect against the harms of \nthese technologies, various panelists emphasized that transparency is important but is not enough to achieve \naccountability. Some panelists discussed their individual views on additional system needs for validity, and \nagreed upon the importance of advisory boards and compensated community input early in the design process \n(before the technology is built and instituted). Various panelists also emphasized the importance of regulation \nthat includes limits to the type and cost of such technologies. 56\n", "type": "Document"}

Employment-related concerning uses included discrimination in automated hiring \nscreening and workplace surveillance. Various panelists raised the limitations of existing privacy law as a key \nconcern, pointing out that students should be able to reinvent themselves and require privacy of their student \nrecords and education-related data in order to do so. The overarching concerns of surveillance in these \ndomains included concerns about the chilling effects of surveillance on student expression, inappropriate \ncontrol of tenants via surveillance, and the way that surveillance of workers blurs the boundary between work \nand life and exerts extreme and potentially damaging control over workers' lives. Additionally, some panelists \npointed out ways that data from one situation was misapplied in another in a way that limited people's \nopportunities, for example data from criminal justice settings or previous evictions being used to block further \naccess to housing. Throughout, various panelists emphasized that these technologies are being used to shift the \nburden of oversight and efficiency from employers to workers, schools to students, and landlords to tenants, in \nways that diminish and encroach on equality of opportunity; assessment of these technologies should include \nwhether they are genuinely helpful in solving an identified problem. In discussion of technical and governance interventions that that are needed to protect against the harms of \nthese technologies, panelists individually described the importance of: receiving community input into the \ndesign and use of technologies, public reporting on crucial elements of these systems, better notice and consent \nprocedures that ensure privacy based on context and use case, ability to opt-out of using these systems and \nreceive a fallback to a human process, providing explanations of decisions and how these systems work, the \nneed for governance including training in using these systems, ensuring the technological use cases are \ngenuinely related to the goal task and are locally validated to work, and the need for institution and protection \nof third party audits to ensure systems continue to be accountable and valid. 57\n", "type": "Document"}

However, various panelists individually cautioned that these systems may reduce burden for government \nagencies by increasing the burden and agency of people using and interacting with these technologies. Additionally, these systems can produce feedback loops and compounded harm, collecting data from \ncommunities and using it to reinforce inequality. Various panelists suggested that these harms could be \nmitigated by ensuring community input at the beginning of the design process, providing ways to opt out of \nthese systems and use associated human-driven mechanisms instead, ensuring timeliness of benefit payments, \nand providing clear notice about the use of these systems and clear explanations of how and what the \ntechnologies are doing. Some panelists suggested that technology should be used to help people receive \nbenefits, e.g., by pushing benefits to those in need and ensuring automated decision-making systems are only \nused to provide a positive outcome; technology shouldn't be used to take supports away from people who need \nthem.

A pro\ufb01le is an implementation of the AI RMF functions, categories, and subcategories for a speci\ufb01c \nsetting, application, or technology \u2013 in this case, Generative AI (GAI) \u2013 based on the requirements, risk \ntolerance, and resources of the Framework user. AI RMF pro\ufb01les assist organizations in deciding how to \nbest manage AI risks in a manner that is well-aligned with their goals, considers legal/regulatory \nrequirements and best practices, and re\ufb02ects risk management priorities. Consistent with other AI RMF \npro\ufb01les, this pro\ufb01le o\ufb00ers insights into how risk can be managed across various stages of the AI lifecycle \nand for GAI as a technology. As GAI covers risks of models or applications that can be used across use cases or sectors, this document \nis an AI RMF cross-sectoral pro\ufb01le. Cross-sectoral pro\ufb01les can be used to govern, map, measure, and \nmanage risks associated with activities or business processes common across sectors, such as the use of \nlarge language models (LLMs), cloud-based services, or acquisition. This document de\ufb01nes risks that are novel to or exacerbated by the use of GAI. After introducing and \ndescribing these risks, the document provides a set of suggested actions to help organizations govern, \nmap, measure, and manage these risks. 1 EO 14110 de\ufb01nes Generative AI as \u201cthe class of AI models that emulate the structure and characteristics of input \ndata in order to generate derived synthetic content. This can include images, videos, audio, text, and other digital \ncontent.\u201d While not all GAI is derived from foundation models, for purposes of this document, GAI generally refers \nto generative foundation models. The foundation model subcategory of \u201cdual-use foundation models\u201d is de\ufb01ned by \nEO 14110 as \u201can AI model that is trained on broad data; generally uses self-supervision; contains at least tens of \nbillions of parameters; is applicable across a wide range of contexts.\u201d  \n2 This pro\ufb01le was developed per Section 4.1(a)(i)(A) of EO 14110, which directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting \nthrough the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to develop a companion \nresource to the AI RMF, NIST AI 100\u20131, for generative AI. 2 \nThis work was informed by public feedback and consultations with diverse stakeholder groups as part of NIST\u2019s \nGenerative AI Public Working Group (GAI PWG). The GAI PWG was an open, transparent, and collaborative \nprocess, facilitated via a virtual workspace, to obtain multistakeholder input on GAI risk management and to \ninform NIST\u2019s approach. The focus of the GAI PWG was limited to four primary considerations relevant to GAI: Governance, Content \nProvenance, Pre-deployment Testing, and Incident Disclosure (further described in Appendix A). As such, the \nsuggested actions in this document primarily address these considerations. Future revisions of this pro\ufb01le will include additional AI RMF subcategories, risks, and suggested actions based \non additional considerations of GAI as the space evolves and empirical evidence indicates additional risks. A \nglossary of terms pertinent to GAI risk management will be developed and hosted on NIST\u2019s Trustworthy & \nResponsible AI Resource Center (AIRC), and added to The Language of Trustworthy AI: An In-Depth Glossary of \nTerms.

{"id": null, "metadata": {"section": "\n2. \nOverview of Risks Unique to or Exacerbated by GAI"}, "page_content": " \nIn the context of the AI RMF, risk refers to the composite measure of an event\u2019s probability (or \nlikelihood) of occurring and the magnitude or degree of the consequences of the corresponding event. Some risks can be assessed as likely to materialize in a given context, particularly those that have been \nempirically demonstrated in similar contexts. Other risks may be unlikely to materialize in a given \ncontext, or may be more speculative and therefore uncertain. AI risks can di\ufb00er from or intensify traditional software risks. Likewise, GAI can exacerbate existing AI \nrisks, and creates unique risks. GAI risks can vary along many dimensions: \n\u2022 \nStage of the AI lifecycle: Risks can arise during design, development, deployment, operation, \nand/or decommissioning. \u2022 \nScope: Risks may exist at individual model or system levels, at the application or implementation \nlevels (i.e., for a speci\ufb01c use case), or at the ecosystem level \u2013 that is, beyond a single system or \norganizational context. Examples of the latter include the expansion of \u201calgorithmic \nmonocultures,3\u201d resulting from repeated use of the same model, or impacts on access to \nopportunity, labor markets, and the creative economies.4 \n\u2022 \nSource of risk: Risks may emerge from factors related to the design, training, or operation of the \nGAI model itself, stemming in some cases from GAI model or system inputs, and in other cases, \nfrom GAI system outputs. Many GAI risks, however, originate from human behavior, including \n \n \n3 \u201cAlgorithmic monocultures\u201d refers to the phenomenon in which repeated use of the same model or algorithm in \nconsequential decision-making settings like employment and lending can result in increased susceptibility by \nsystems to correlated failures (like unexpected shocks), due to multiple actors relying on the same algorithm. 4 Many studies have projected the impact of AI on the workforce and labor markets. Fewer studies have examined \nthe impact of GAI on the labor market, though some industry surveys indicate that that both employees and \nemployers are pondering this disruption. 3 \nthe abuse, misuse, and unsafe repurposing by humans (adversarial or not), and others result \nfrom interactions between a human and an AI system. \u2022 \nTime scale: GAI risks may materialize abruptly or across extended periods. Examples include \nimmediate (and/or prolonged) emotional harm and potential risks to physical safety due to the \ndistribution of harmful deepfake images, or the long-term e\ufb00ect of disinformation on societal \ntrust in public institutions. The presence of risks and where they fall along the dimensions above will vary depending on the \ncharacteristics of the GAI model, system, or use case at hand. These characteristics include but are not \nlimited to GAI model or system architecture, training mechanisms and libraries, data types used for \ntraining or \ufb01ne-tuning, levels of model access or availability of model weights, and application or use \ncase context. Organizations may choose to tailor how they measure GAI risks based on these characteristics. They may \nadditionally wish to allocate risk management resources relative to the severity and likelihood of \nnegative impacts, including where and how these risks manifest, and their direct and material impacts \nharms in the context of GAI use. Mitigations for model or system level risks may di\ufb00er from mitigations \nfor use-case or ecosystem level risks. Importantly, some GAI risks are unknown, and are therefore di\ufb03cult to properly scope or evaluate given \nthe uncertainty about potential GAI scale, complexity, and capabilities. Other risks may be known but \ndi\ufb03cult to estimate given the wide range of GAI stakeholders, uses, inputs, and outputs. Challenges with \nrisk estimation are aggravated by a lack of visibility into GAI training data, and the generally immature \nstate of the science of AI measurement and safety today. This document focuses on risks for which there \nis an existing empirical evidence base at the time this pro\ufb01le was written; for example, speculative risks \nthat may potentially arise in more advanced, future GAI systems are not considered. Future updates may \nincorporate additional risks or provide further details on the risks identi\ufb01ed below. To guide organizations in identifying and managing GAI risks, a set of risks unique to or exacerbated by \nthe development and use of GAI are de\ufb01ned below.5 Each risk is labeled according to the outcome, \nobject, or source of the risk (i.e., some are risks \u201cto\u201d a subject or domain and others are risks \u201cof\u201d or \n\u201cfrom\u201d an issue or theme). These risks provide a lens through which organizations can frame and execute \nrisk management e\ufb00orts. To help streamline risk management e\ufb00orts, each risk is mapped in Section 3 \n(as well as in tables in Appendix B) to relevant Trustworthy AI Characteristics identi\ufb01ed in the AI RMF. 5 These risks can be further categorized by organizations depending on their unique approaches to risk de\ufb01nition \nand management. One possible way to further categorize these risks, derived in part from the UK\u2019s International \nScienti\ufb01c Report on the Safety of Advanced AI, could be: 1) Technical / Model risks (or risk from malfunction): \nConfabulation; Dangerous or Violent Recommendations; Data Privacy; Value Chain and Component Integration; \nHarmful Bias, and Homogenization; 2) Misuse by humans (or malicious use): CBRN Information or Capabilities; \nData Privacy; Human-AI Con\ufb01guration; Obscene, Degrading, and/or Abusive Content; Information Integrity; \nInformation Security; 3) Ecosystem / societal risks (or systemic risks): Data Privacy; Environmental; Intellectual \nProperty.

The physical synthesis development, production, and use of chemical or \nbiological agents will continue to require both applicable expertise and supporting materials and \ninfrastructure. The impact of GAI on chemical or biological agent misuse will depend on what the key \nbarriers for malicious actors are (e.g., whether information access is one such barrier), and how well GAI \ncan help actors address those barriers.

For example, when prompted to generate images of CEOs, doctors, lawyers, and judges, current \ntext-to-image models underrepresent women and/or racial minorities, and people with disabilities.

Harmful bias in GAI models, which \nmay stem from their training data, can also cause representational harms or perpetuate or exacerbate \nbias based on race, gender, disability, or other protected classes. Harmful bias in GAI systems can also lead to harms via disparities between how a model performs for \ndi\ufb00erent subgroups or languages (e.g., an LLM may perform less well for non-English languages or \ncertain dialects).

{"id": null, "metadata": {"section": "Appendix A. Primary GAI Considerations"}, "page_content": "Governance \nA.1.1. Overview \nLike any other technology system, governance principles and techniques can be used to manage risks \nrelated to generative AI models, capabilities, and applications. Organizations may choose to apply their \nexisting risk tiering to GAI systems, or they may opt to revise or update AI system risk levels to address \nthese unique GAI risks. This section describes how organizational governance regimes may be re-\nevaluated and adjusted for GAI contexts. It also addresses third-party considerations for governing across \nthe AI value chain. A.1.2. Organizational Governance \nGAI opportunities, risks and long-term performance characteristics are typically less well-understood \nthan non-generative AI tools and may be perceived and acted upon by humans in ways that vary greatly. Accordingly, GAI may call for di\ufb00erent levels of oversight from AI Actors or di\ufb00erent human-AI \ncon\ufb01gurations in order to manage their risks e\ufb00ectively. Organizations\u2019 use of GAI systems may also \nwarrant additional human review, tracking and documentation, and greater management oversight. AI technology can produce varied outputs in multiple modalities and present many classes of user \ninterfaces. This leads to a broader set of AI Actors interacting with GAI systems for widely di\ufb00ering \napplications and contexts of use. These can include data labeling and preparation, development of GAI \nmodels, content moderation, code generation and review, text generation and editing, image and video \ngeneration, summarization, search, and chat. These activities can take place within organizational \nsettings or in the public domain. Organizations can restrict AI applications that cause harm, exceed stated risk tolerances, or that con\ufb02ict \nwith their tolerances or values. Governance tools and protocols that are applied to other types of AI \nsystems can be applied to GAI systems. These plans and actions include: \n\u2022 Accessibility and reasonable \naccommodations \n\u2022 AI actor credentials and quali\ufb01cations  \n\u2022 Alignment to organizational values \n\u2022 Auditing and assessment \n\u2022 Change-management controls \n\u2022 Commercial use \n\u2022 Data provenance \n \n48 \n\u2022 Data protection \n\u2022 Data retention  \n\u2022 Consistency in use of de\ufb01ning key terms \n\u2022 Decommissioning \n\u2022 Discouraging anonymous use \n\u2022 Education  \n\u2022 Impact assessments  \n\u2022 Incident response \n\u2022 Monitoring \n\u2022 Opt-outs  \n\u2022 Risk-based controls \n\u2022 Risk mapping and measurement \n\u2022 Science-backed TEVV practices \n\u2022 Secure software development practices \n\u2022 Stakeholder engagement \n\u2022 Synthetic content detection and \nlabeling tools and techniques \n\u2022 Whistleblower protections \n\u2022 Workforce diversity and \ninterdisciplinary teams\nEstablishing acceptable use policies and guidance for the use of GAI in formal human-AI teaming settings \nas well as di\ufb00erent levels of human-AI con\ufb01gurations can help to decrease risks arising from misuse, \nabuse, inappropriate repurpose, and misalignment between systems and users.

{"id": null, "metadata": {"section": "Appendix A. Primary GAI Considerations"}, "page_content": "A.1.3. Third-Party Considerations \nOrganizations may seek to acquire, embed, incorporate, or use open-source or proprietary third-party \nGAI models, systems, or generated data for various applications across an enterprise. Use of these GAI \ntools and inputs has implications for all functions of the organization \u2013 including but not limited to \nacquisition, human resources, legal, compliance, and IT services \u2013 regardless of whether they are carried \nout by employees or third parties. Many of the actions cited above are relevant and options for \naddressing third-party considerations. Third party GAI integrations may give rise to increased intellectual property, data privacy, or information \nsecurity risks, pointing to the need for clear guidelines for transparency and risk management regarding \nthe collection and use of third-party data for model inputs. Organizations may consider varying risk \ncontrols for foundation models, \ufb01ne-tuned models, and embedded tools, enhanced processes for \ninteracting with external GAI technologies or service providers. Organizations can apply standard or \nexisting risk controls and processes to proprietary or open-source GAI technologies, data, and third-party \nservice providers, including acquisition and procurement due diligence, requests for software bills of \nmaterials (SBOMs), application of service level agreements (SLAs), and statement on standards for \nattestation engagement (SSAE) reports to help with third-party transparency and risk management for \nGAI systems. A.1.4. Pre-Deployment Testing \nOverview \nThe diverse ways and contexts in which GAI systems may be developed, used, and repurposed \ncomplicates risk mapping and pre-deployment measurement e\ufb00orts. Robust test, evaluation, validation, \nand veri\ufb01cation (TEVV) processes can be iteratively applied \u2013 and documented \u2013 in early stages of the AI \nlifecycle and informed by representative AI Actors (see Figure 3 of the AI RMF). Until new and rigorous \n \n49 \nearly lifecycle TEVV approaches are developed and matured for GAI, organizations may use \nrecommended \u201cpre-deployment testing\u201d practices to measure performance, capabilities, limits, risks, \nand impacts. This section describes risk measurement and estimation as part of pre-deployment TEVV, \nand examines the state of play for pre-deployment testing methodologies. Limitations of Current Pre-deployment Test Approaches \nCurrently available pre-deployment TEVV processes used for GAI applications may be inadequate, non-\nsystematically applied, or fail to re\ufb02ect or mismatched to deployment contexts. For example, the \nanecdotal testing of GAI system capabilities through video games or standardized tests designed for \nhumans (e.g., intelligence tests, professional licensing exams) does not guarantee GAI system validity or \nreliability in those domains. Similarly, jailbreaking or prompt engineering tests may not systematically \nassess validity or reliability risks. Measurement gaps can arise from mismatches between laboratory and real-world settings. Current \ntesting approaches often remain focused on laboratory conditions or restricted to benchmark test \ndatasets and in silico techniques that may not extrapolate well to\u2014or directly assess GAI impacts in real-\nworld conditions. For example, current measurement gaps for GAI make it di\ufb03cult to precisely estimate \nits potential ecosystem-level or longitudinal risks and related political, social, and economic impacts. Gaps between benchmarks and real-world use of GAI systems may likely be exacerbated due to prompt \nsensitivity and broad heterogeneity of contexts of use. A.1.5. Structured Public Feedback \nStructured public feedback can be used to evaluate whether GAI systems are performing as intended \nand to calibrate and verify traditional measurement methods. Examples of structured feedback include, \nbut are not limited to: \n\u2022 \nParticipatory Engagement Methods: Methods used to solicit feedback from civil society groups, \na\ufb00ected communities, and users, including focus groups, small user studies, and surveys. \u2022 \nField Testing: Methods used to determine how people interact with, consume, use, and make \nsense of AI-generated information, and subsequent actions and e\ufb00ects, including UX, usability, \nand other structured, randomized experiments.", "type": "Document"}

Participatory \nengagement methods are often less structured than \ufb01eld testing or red teaming, and are more \ncommonly used in early stages of AI or product development. Field Testing \nField testing involves structured settings to evaluate risks and impacts and to simulate the conditions \nunder which the GAI system will be deployed. Field style tests can be adapted from a focus on user \npreferences and experiences towards AI risks and impacts \u2013 both negative and positive. When carried \nout with large groups of users, these tests can provide estimations of the likelihood of risks and impacts \nin real world interactions. Organizations may also collect feedback on outcomes, harms, and user experience directly from users in \nthe production environment after a model has been released, in accordance with human subject \nstandards such as informed consent and compensation. Organizations should follow applicable human \nsubjects research requirements, and best practices such as informed consent and subject compensation, \nwhen implementing feedback activities. AI Red-teaming \nAI red-teaming is an evolving practice that references exercises often conducted in a controlled \nenvironment and in collaboration with AI developers building AI models to identify potential adverse \nbehavior or outcomes of a GAI model or system, how they could occur, and stress test safeguards\u201d. AI \nred-teaming can be performed before or after AI models or systems are made available to the broader \npublic; this section focuses on red-teaming in pre-deployment contexts. The quality of AI red-teaming outputs is related to the background and expertise of the AI red team \nitself. Demographically and interdisciplinarily diverse AI red teams can be used to identify \ufb02aws in the \nvarying contexts where GAI will be used. For best results, AI red teams should demonstrate domain \nexpertise, and awareness of socio-cultural aspects within the deployment context. AI red-teaming results \nshould be given additional analysis before they are incorporated into organizational governance and \ndecision making, policy and procedural updates, and AI risk management e\ufb00orts. Various types of AI red-teaming may be appropriate, depending on the use case: \n\u2022 \nGeneral Public: Performed by general users (not necessarily AI or technical experts) who are \nexpected to use the model or interact with its outputs, and who bring their own lived \nexperiences and perspectives to the task of AI red-teaming. These individuals may have been \nprovided instructions and material to complete tasks which may elicit harmful model behaviors. This type of exercise can be more e\ufb00ective with large groups of AI red-teamers. \u2022 \nExpert: Performed by specialists with expertise in the domain or speci\ufb01c AI red-teaming context \nof use (e.g., medicine, biotech, cybersecurity). \u2022 \nCombination: In scenarios when it is di\ufb03cult to identify and recruit specialists with su\ufb03cient \ndomain and contextual expertise, AI red-teaming exercises may leverage both expert and \n \n51 \ngeneral public participants. For example, expert AI red-teamers could modify or verify the \nprompts written by general public AI red-teamers. These approaches may also expand coverage \nof the AI risk attack surface. \u2022 \nHuman / AI: Performed by GAI in combination with specialist or non-specialist human teams. GAI-led red-teaming can be more cost e\ufb00ective than human red-teamers alone. Human or GAI-\nled AI red-teaming may be better suited for eliciting di\ufb00erent types of harms. A.1.6. Content Provenance \nOverview \nGAI technologies can be leveraged for many applications such as content generation and synthetic data. Some aspects of GAI outputs, such as the production of deepfake content, can challenge our ability to \ndistinguish human-generated content from AI-generated synthetic content. To help manage and mitigate \nthese risks, digital transparency mechanisms like provenance data tracking can trace the origin and \nhistory of content. Provenance data tracking and synthetic content detection can help facilitate greater \ninformation access about both authentic and synthetic content to users, enabling better knowledge of \ntrustworthiness in AI systems. When combined with other organizational accountability mechanisms, \ndigital content transparency approaches can enable processes to trace negative outcomes back to their \nsource, improve information integrity, and uphold public trust. Provenance data tracking and synthetic \ncontent detection mechanisms provide information about the origin and history of content to assist in \nGAI risk management e\ufb00orts. Provenance metadata can include information about GAI model developers or creators of GAI content, \ndate/time of creation, location, modi\ufb01cations, and sources. Metadata can be tracked for text, images, \nvideos, audio, and underlying datasets. The implementation of provenance data tracking techniques can \nhelp assess the authenticity, integrity, intellectual property rights, and potential manipulations in digital \ncontent. Some well-known techniques for provenance data tracking include digital watermarking, \nmetadata recording, digital \ufb01ngerprinting, and human authentication, among others. Provenance Data Tracking Approaches \nProvenance data tracking techniques for GAI systems can be used to track the history and origin of data \ninputs, metadata, and synthetic content. Provenance data tracking records the origin and history for \ndigital content, allowing its authenticity to be determined. It consists of techniques to record metadata \nas well as overt and covert digital watermarks on content. Data provenance refers to tracking the origin \nand history of input data through metadata and digital watermarking techniques. Provenance data \ntracking processes can include and assist AI Actors across the lifecycle who may not have full visibility or \ncontrol over the various trade-o\ufb00s and cascading impacts of early-stage model decisions on downstream \nperformance and synthetic outputs. For example, by selecting a watermarking model to prioritize \nrobustness (the durability of a watermark), an AI actor may inadvertently diminish computational \ncomplexity (the resources required to implement watermarking). Organizational risk management \ne\ufb00orts for enhancing content provenance include:  \n\u2022 \nTracking provenance of training data and metadata for GAI systems; \n\u2022 \nDocumenting provenance data limitations within GAI systems; \n \n52 \n\u2022 \nMonitoring system capabilities and limitations in deployment through rigorous TEVV processes; \n\u2022 \nEvaluating how humans engage, interact with, or adapt to GAI content (especially in decision \nmaking tasks informed by GAI content), and how they react to applied provenance techniques \nsuch as overt disclosures. Organizations can document and delineate GAI system objectives and limitations to identify gaps where \nprovenance data may be most useful. For instance, GAI systems used for content creation may require \nrobust watermarking techniques and corresponding detectors to identify the source of content or \nmetadata recording techniques and metadata management tools and repositories to trace content \norigins and modi\ufb01cations. Further narrowing of GAI task de\ufb01nitions to include provenance data can \nenable organizations to maximize the utility of provenance data and risk management e\ufb00orts. A.1.7. Enhancing Content Provenance through Structured Public Feedback \nWhile indirect feedback methods such as automated error collection systems are useful, they often lack \nthe context and depth that direct input from end users can provide. Organizations can leverage feedback \napproaches described in the Pre-Deployment Testing section to capture input from external sources such \nas through AI red-teaming. Integrating pre- and post-deployment external feedback into the monitoring process for GAI models and \ncorresponding applications can help enhance awareness of performance changes and mitigate potential \nrisks and harms from outputs. There are many ways to capture and make use of user feedback \u2013 before \nand after GAI systems and digital content transparency approaches are deployed \u2013 to gain insights about \nauthentication e\ufb03cacy and vulnerabilities, impacts of adversarial threats on techniques, and unintended \nconsequences resulting from the utilization of content provenance approaches on users and \ncommunities. Furthermore, organizations can track and document the provenance of datasets to identify \ninstances in which AI-generated data is a potential root cause of performance issues with the GAI \nsystem.", "type": "Document"}
{"id": null, "metadata": {"section": "Appendix A. Primary GAI Considerations"}, "page_content": "A.1.8. Incident Disclosure \nOverview \nAI incidents can be de\ufb01ned as an \u201cevent, circumstance, or series of events where the development, use, \nor malfunction of one or more AI systems directly or indirectly contributes to one of the following harms: \ninjury or harm to the health of a person or groups of people (including psychological harms and harms to \nmental health); disruption of the management and operation of critical infrastructure; violations of \nhuman rights or a breach of obligations under applicable law intended to protect fundamental, labor, \nand intellectual property rights; or harm to property, communities, or the environment.\u201d AI incidents can \noccur in the aggregate (i.e., for systemic discrimination) or acutely (i.e., for one individual). State of AI Incident Tracking and Disclosure \nFormal channels do not currently exist to report and document AI incidents. However, a number of \npublicly available databases have been created to document their occurrence. These reporting channels \nmake decisions on an ad hoc basis about what kinds of incidents to track. Some, for example, track by \namount of media coverage. 53 \nDocumenting, reporting, and sharing information about GAI incidents can help mitigate and prevent \nharmful outcomes by assisting relevant AI Actors in tracing impacts to their source. Greater awareness \nand standardization of GAI incident reporting could promote this transparency and improve GAI risk \nmanagement across the AI ecosystem. Documentation and Involvement of AI Actors \nAI Actors should be aware of their roles in reporting AI incidents. To better understand previous incidents \nand implement measures to prevent similar ones in the future, organizations could consider developing \nguidelines for publicly available incident reporting which include information about AI actor \nresponsibilities. These guidelines would help AI system operators identify GAI incidents across the AI \nlifecycle and with AI Actors regardless of role. Documentation and review of third-party inputs and \nplugins for GAI systems is especially important for AI Actors in the context of incident disclosure; LLM \ninputs and content delivered through these plugins is often distributed, with inconsistent or insu\ufb03cient \naccess control. Documentation practices including logging, recording, and analyzing GAI incidents can facilitate \nsmoother sharing of information with relevant AI Actors. Regular information sharing, change \nmanagement records, version history and metadata can also empower AI Actors responding to and \nmanaging AI incidents. 54 \n", "type": "Document"}
